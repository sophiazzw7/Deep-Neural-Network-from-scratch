Sure! Here's the documentation report I had drafted earlier for you based on the provided model documentation:

### **Model Documentation Report**

#### **1. Overview**

This documentation outlines the model assumptions, limitations, data sources, and performance monitoring framework for the workforce scheduling model used across branches. The model forecasts future transactions and sales to optimize staffing schedules. 

#### **2. Model Assumptions and Limitations**

- **Judgmental Assumptions**: 
    The model is based on several assumptions related to data inputs, coverage, and methodologies. These include updates "as needed" with annual updates based on input from subject matter experts. The model assumes key performance metrics, such as schedule effectiveness (remaining above 80%), will be maintained to ensure reliable forecasts.

    MRO has reviewed these assumptions and found them appropriate for the model's business objectives. However, specific triggers for updates are not clearly defined. MRO recommends documenting these triggers to ensure the model remains responsive to operational changes.

- **Data Completeness, Quality, and Assumptions Review**: 
    MRO's assessment of data sources (e.g., Teller Transaction System, Client Central) indicates that while relevant, some critical elements are missing or insufficiently documented. These gaps could impact the overall data quality, representativeness, and long-term model accuracy. 

#### **3. Data Sources and Controls**

- **CloudCords Forecast and Truist Data Feeds**: 
    The data source for this model is CloudCords, using Truist transaction and sales data. The WFP team monitors imports of the Truist data monthly to ensure accuracy before forecasting.
    
    The data import process from Truist to the CloudCords forecaster is a critical step, and appropriate controls are in place to maintain the integrity of the data inputs. However, further documentation on validation checks and lineage tracking could enhance the robustness of these processes.

#### **4. Performance Monitoring and OGM Plan**

- **Forecast Accuracy Monitoring**:
    The forecast's accuracy is critical to the FTE plan and is tested monthly across branches. The industry standard for forecasting accuracy is set at <5% for teller transactions and <20% for platform transactions.
    
    - "The OGM team will monitor the actuals vs forecast a minimum of 12 times per year or once a month. OGM includes the performance baseline of <5% threshold for teller and <20% threshold for platform across all branches."
    
    If these baselines are not met, the OGM process is initiated to investigate causes, with outliers identified for further review.

- **Escalation Plan for Threshold Breaches**:
    An escalation plan is in place to handle instances where actual vs forecast variance exceeds the established thresholds. The Workforce Planning Team (WFP) works with the Vendor to escalate any performance issues, and compensating measures are determined as needed.

    - "If the error rate of <5% for teller and <20% for platform are outside of tolerance, the model output may warrant the need for compensating controls of adjusting the staffing plan for the month."

#### **5. Overrides and Adjustments**

- **Override Monitoring**:
    The model allows for temporary overrides due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., unknown business growth, community changes). However, the monitoring of these overrides should include metrics on the magnitude, trend, and long-term impact on performance.
    
    - "Overrides are defined as temporary (one-off) process, business rule, or logic where model output is temporarily altered."
    
    Documentation on these overrides should be maintained for transparency, including the rationale and challenges faced during the implementation of these overrides.

#### **6. Recommendations and Findings**

- **Data Validation**: While the WFP team conducts monthly checks, additional documentation on data validation, smoothing techniques, and transformations applied to the data would further enhance transparency.
- **Triggers for Updates**: More detailed triggers for model updates, particularly in response to significant operational changes, should be clearly defined.
- **Override Documentation**: Detailed monitoring and documentation of overrides should be incorporated to assess their long-term impact on model performance.
- **Threshold Rationale**: Justifications for thresholds (<5% for teller transactions and <20% for platform) should be expanded, considering both internal and external risk factors.
