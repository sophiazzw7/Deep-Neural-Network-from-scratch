### Results
Throughout this year, I've grown significantly in my role, taking on new challenges and expanding my expertise beyond retail model validation. I'm particularly proud of how I've contributed to our team's growth while maintaining high standards in our validation projects.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1. **Expanding into Wholesale Model Validation:** I saw an opportunity to grow beyond retail models and actively sought out wholesale validation projects. This not only helped me develop new skills but also gave our team more flexibility in handling different types of validations.

2. **Operational Risk Management Model Validation:**
   - Working closely with our internal teams and external vendor, I made sure we had a clear picture of the model's actual use and functionality
   - After thorough analysis, I identified that the tool would be better classified as a non-model - a finding that helped ensure proper categorization and compliance
   - Even when communications became challenging, I maintained a constructive approach to keep the project moving forward

3. **Wholesale Compensating Control Models:**
   - While reviewing exit requests for six wholesale models with my team, I discovered some concerning issues in how model developers were tracking PD trends and defining coverage
   - By catching these errors early, we avoided potential compliance problems and helped ensure our models stayed accurate
   - I kept everyone in the loop with regular updates and detailed summaries, which helped us close reviews efficiently while maintaining compliance

4. **ZORS Models Validation:** Leading the full-scope validation of ZORS was particularly challenging. When I noticed potential gaps in the vendor's OGM reports, I didn't hesitate to bring these concerns to upper management, making sure we addressed these issues before they could impact our work.

5. **Supporting Our Team's Technical Evolution:** As we moved toward using Python/Anaconda, I took an active role in helping the team adapt:
   - Put together and delivered two training sessions covering Python, Anaconda, PyCharm, and PIML
   - Stepped up as a resource for my colleagues, helping with everything from initial setup to troubleshooting
   - Created and shared practical Python examples and resources to help ease the transition from SAS
   - Started weekly sessions to help integrate our SAS datasets with Python tools in Anaconda

### Behaviors
Looking back, I've tried to embody Truist's values in my daily work:

- **Trustworthy:** Whether I'm analyzing risks or collaborating with colleagues, I've made it a priority to be transparent and thorough in everything I do.
  
- **Caring:** Seeing my colleagues succeed with Python has been particularly rewarding. I've enjoyed creating a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable asking questions and learning together.

- **One Team:** I believe our best work happens when we collaborate openly. By sharing knowledge and supporting my teammates, I've tried to contribute to a culture where we all succeed together.

- **Success:** My focus has always been on delivering results that make a real difference. I take pride in raising our validation standards and finding ways to improve our processes.

- **Happiness:** Even during challenging projects, I've maintained an optimistic outlook. I find that enthusiasm for learning is contagious, and it helps create a more positive work environment.

### Risk Management Effectiveness
Risk management has been at the core of my work this year:

- **Awareness:** Staying up-to-date with compliance requirements has helped me adapt quickly to new challenges in model validation.

- **Identification:** During the compensating control project, catching errors in PD trend tracking and coverage definitions early helped prevent potential issues down the line.

- **Escalation:** With the ZORS model validation, I made sure potential issues with OGM reports were brought to management's attention quickly, allowing us to address them promptly.

- **Mitigation:** I've been thorough in following risk procedures and working with stakeholders to address any gaps we've found. The compensating control models project really showed how this attention to detail helps maintain our risk management standards.

### Growth & Development
This year has been full of learning opportunities:

1. **Career Growth:** Taking on wholesale and operational risk model validations has broadened my perspective and made me more versatile in my role.

2. **Building Relationships:** Projects like ZORS and the compensating control models have helped me build stronger connections across teams. Even in difficult conversations, I've focused on maintaining open dialogue and finding common ground.

3. **Technical Growth:** Leading our transition to Python/Anaconda has pushed me to deepen my technical skills while helping others develop theirs.

4. **Embracing Challenges:** Each new project - whether it was wholesale validation, compensating controls, or vendor model reviews - has helped me grow professionally.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to keep building my Python expertise, dive deeper into wholesale and operational risk models, and work on becoming an even more effective communicator.
