### Data Completeness, Quality, and Assumptions Review

**Overview**  
The model documentation details several data sources used to build the forecasting model. Section 1.8 of the documentation provides a breakdown of data inputs such as teller transaction data, sales activity volumes, and servicing activity volumes. Additionally, it outlines how branch hierarchy and attributes were updated for the model as of January 2021. MRO reviewed the development data sources and concluded that they are comprehensive and relevant for achieving the business objective.

**Data Sources and Inputs**  
The following data sources were used in the model development:
- **Teller/Universal Arrivals and Transaction Volume**: Derived from 24 months of historical transaction data from legacy systems. This data was vetted for transaction volumes and other parameters.
- **Platform/Universal Sales and Service Volume**: Sales and service volumes are used to capture client-facing activities. The data covers new accounts, loans, and service inquiries.
- **Non-Client Facing Activities**: Includes activities like ATM servicing, vault balancing, and audits. These are supported by industry-standard metrics and validated through field studies conducted by Kiran consultants.

**Data Quality Assessment**  
As documented in Section 1.12 and 1.13, data quality was validated through various procedures:
- **Anomalies Identification**: The Kiran and Truist WFM team reviewed field study data and implemented procedures to exclude anomalies, as shown in Table 1-5-2. For example, excessively long teller sessions or mismatched banker session records were excluded from the analysis.
- **Field Validation**: Data collected during the field study was validated against internal transaction volumes and field observations. Truistâ€™s internal data was cross-verified with field study outputs to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**Reasonability of Data Assumptions**  
Based on Section 1.15, the data assumptions for developing the model are well-documented. The assumptions consider factors like non-uniform distribution of work, such as branch-specific attributes and industry standards. Additionally, the model accounts for common drivers of non-client-facing activities like cash shipments, audits, and meetings, ensuring a reasonable reflection of real-world branch activities.

Does this revised section cover what you were aiming for? Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!

Let's review **Section 4: Review of Data Quality and Data Appropriateness** critically, based solely on the documentation you provided. I'll ensure no inferences or assumptions are made, and if something is missing or unclear in the documentation, I will note it as a finding.

### **4. Review of Data Quality and Data Appropriateness**

#### **4.1 Summary of Data Processing**

**Data Sources**  
The data sources used in the model are partially documented in **Section 1.8 (Development Data Sources)**. It provides an overview of the teller, platform, and universal transaction volumes. It mentions:
- **Teller transactions** are traced from specific system sources (BB&T PC Teller System and Enterprise Teller System) and cover 24 months of historical data.
- **Platform/Universal Sales and Service Volumes** are derived from BB&T Client Central and other internal systems, also spanning 24 months.
- **Non-Customer Facing Activities** are based on standard activities such as ATM servicing, vault balancing, and coaching.

However, the documentation **does not provide a complete data dictionary** or **data creation rules** for each variable used in the model.

- **F_0001**: Please include a detailed data dictionary with descriptions of all variables, the variable creation rules, source data fields, units, decoding rules for categorical variables, and basic descriptive statistics.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
The process of **data aggregation and transformation** is outlined in **Section 1.11 (Data Aggregation and Transformations)**. Each dataset (e.g., Teller Transactions, DEP Sales) goes through a mapping process, aligning transactions to forecast and time-standard groups. It also describes the removal of unneeded transactions, such as **night deposits**.

The documentation includes **examples of data anomalies** in **Section 1.12** (e.g., excessively long teller sessions) and outlines how these anomalies are excluded from the model. This ensures a certain level of data cleaning is performed. However, there is no mention of how missing or corrupted data is handled beyond these exclusions.

- **F_0002**: Please provide details about how missing, corrupted, or incomplete data is handled in the data cleaning process.

**Code Documentation**  
The documentation does not currently provide information on the specific code used to process data. Without code references, the traceability of the data transformation process is limited.

- **F_0003**: Please provide documentation of the code used to process source data into final model development datasets.

#### **4.2 Data Quality Assessment**

**Descriptive Analysis**  
There is no mention in the documentation of descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for the variables used in the model. The assessment of variable distribution, including identifying outliers, high concentrations, or missing values, is not documented.

- **F_0004**: Please provide descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for continuous variables, and frequency distribution for categorical variables used in the model.
- **F_0005**: Please include an analysis of outliers and missing values, along with the treatment methodology.

**Duplicated or Missing Data**  
While **Section 1.12** mentions the exclusion of certain records due to anomalies, the documentation does not provide a complete assessment of duplicated or missing values for each variable. Additionally, the methodology for handling these cases is not fully described.

- **F_0006**: Please provide an analysis of duplicated or missing values for each variable, and document the methodology for addressing these issues.

**Consistency Check**  
There is no documentation related to consistency checks for the variables (e.g., ensuring that "age" values are within a sensible range or ensuring that FICO scores aren't negative). While the model uses internal data sources, no documentation ensures that basic consistency checks are applied.

- **F_0007**: Please document any consistency checks performed on the data, ensuring that variables fall within reasonable ranges and values.

**Data Source Evaluation**  
The data sources (e.g., BB&T PC Teller System, Client Central) are from internal systems, but there is no explicit documentation of the reliability or representativeness of these sources in terms of meeting the model objectives. Additionally, there is no mention of any external data sources or validation against external benchmarks.

- **F_0008**: Please provide documentation evaluating the reliability and representativeness of the data sources and whether external validation (if applicable) was considered.

#### **4.3 Data Appropriateness Assessment**

**Data Cleaning Process**  
Section **1.11** provides some details about removing unneeded transactions and aggregating data, but the documentation lacks a more detailed explanation of how data outliers are treated, or how incorrect or corrupted data is fixed. Furthermore, there is no reference to backfilling missing data or addressing incomplete records beyond anomaly exclusion.

- **F_0009**: Please provide a detailed explanation of the data cleaning process, including treatment for corrupted, incorrect, and incomplete data. Mention any specific procedures for backfilling missing data, if applicable.

**Data Transformation**  
The documentation outlines basic data transformations, such as mapping transactions to time standards and forecast groups in **Section 1.11**. However, there is no mention of advanced transformations, such as normalization, clustering, or binning, that may be relevant for this kind of model.

- **F_0010**: Please document any additional data transformation techniques applied, such as normalization, clustering, or binning.

**Data Relevance and Sampling**  
While the model documentation explains the data sources and their relevance for the tasks being modeled, there is no discussion of whether any sampling or re-sampling techniques were applied (e.g., partitioning data into training and validation sets). Given the large dataset (24 months of historical data), this is a notable omission.

- **F_0011**: Please provide information on whether any sampling, re-sampling, or data partitioning methodologies were used and document their appropriateness for the model development process.

**Statistical Validity of Data Assumptions**  
The documentation does not provide explicit statistical validation for the assumptions made about the data, such as ensuring the representativeness of historical data for forecasting future transactions. Without this, it is unclear whether the underlying assumptions about the data's appropriateness for the model objectives were tested.

- **F_0012**: Please provide statistical validation for the assumptions made about the representativeness and appropriateness of the data, particularly in relation to forecasting future transactions.
