### 5. Review of Model Methodology

#### Assessment of Reasonableness

The model developers described the overall approach for the **CloudCords** forecasting model, including key processes like time-series forecasting, queuing models for teller staffing, and resource estimation for non-customer-facing activities. The documentation provided detailed explanations of the segmentation between customer-facing and non-customer-facing activities, which helps structure the forecast to meet the business objective of optimizing branch staffing.

In reviewing the documentation, MRO noted that alternative methodologies, such as traditional queuing models (e.g., Erlang-C) and productivity standards (throughput-based methods), were considered. The chosen queuing models were determined to be more appropriate for the customer-facing tasks, particularly for forecasting staffing needs based on the arrival of customers in a branch. The documentation justifies the selection of the Erlang-C model, while also acknowledging the limitations of this model when applied to environments with high variability in service times, such as platform banker roles. The chosen approach mitigates these issues by using a proprietary queuing model tailored to specific conditions observed in retail banking.

MRO reviewed the alternative methods presented and agrees with the reasoning behind choosing a customized queuing model for customer-facing tasks and a more empirical resource estimation approach for non-customer-facing tasks. Based on this, MRO concludes that the overall methodology, as described, is appropriate for meeting the business objectives.

#### Theoretical and Empirical Support

The model developers referenced the **Holt-Winters time-series** forecasting method for estimating future volumes of branch transactions. According to the documentation, this method allows the model to account for key factors like seasonality, trend, day-of-week effects, and special event adjustments. These factors are clearly outlined in Section 1.8 of the documentation, which describes how different time intervals (e.g., month, week, day) and special conditions (e.g., holidays, promotions) influence transaction volumes. The use of this method is particularly well-suited for banking, where customer behavior tends to follow regular, cyclical patterns.

Additionally, the developers documented empirical data supporting the choice of methodologies. Field studies, as mentioned in Section 1.12, were conducted to assess service times and transaction volumes across various branches, and these studies informed the development of proprietary adjustments to queuing models. For example, based on real-world branch data, the service time distribution for tellers and platform bankers was shown to differ from the assumptions of traditional queuing models, leading to the adoption of a tailored distribution.

MRO reviewed these empirical findings and concluded that the model’s theoretical foundation is supported by evidence collected from actual branch operations. However, it should be noted that while the documentation outlines the model’s theoretical and empirical support, ongoing validation with real-time data is recommended to ensure that the model remains accurate under changing operational conditions.

#### Regulatory and Industry Standard Compliance

While the developers did not provide explicit references to specific regulatory frameworks in the documentation, they claimed alignment with general industry standards for operational resource forecasting in the banking sector. The model methodology involves widely recognized approaches like queuing theory and time-series forecasting, both of which are standard practices for workload and staffing optimization.

MRO reviewed the model methodology and determined that, based on the provided information, there do not appear to be any conflicts with industry-standard practices. Additionally, no mention of accounting rules or specific regulatory requirements was made in the documentation, which suggests that further review may be necessary to verify full compliance with applicable regulations. As such, MRO recommends a focused review to ensure that the model complies with jurisdictional or accounting requirements for staffing models in financial institutions.

#### Judgmental Assumptions

The model developers documented several judgmental assumptions, particularly in **Section 1.5 Key Model Assumptions, Risks & Limitations**, where assumptions related to data inputs, coverage, and methodology were outlined. The developers assume that the model will be updated "as needed," with annual updates to certain inputs (such as non-customer-facing activities and branch attributes) based on input from subject matter experts. The model also assumes that key performance metrics, such as schedule effectiveness (remaining above 80%), will be maintained to ensure the model’s forecasts are reliable.

MRO reviewed these assumptions and found them appropriate given the business objectives of the model. The contingency plans to adjust inputs as needed, as well as to monitor forecast variances and update the model when necessary, provide reasonable safeguards against performance issues. However, the specific triggers for updates are not always clearly defined, and MRO suggests more detailed documentation of these triggers to ensure the model remains responsive to changes in operational environments.

The assumption that qualitative input (e.g., expert judgment on business needs, changes in branch characteristics) will drive some updates is appropriate, but more formalized processes would provide additional clarity. Nevertheless, the current structure of judgmental assumptions is reasonable for the intended use case of staffing optimization.

#### Model Assumptions and Limitations

The developers were transparent about the model’s limitations, particularly the exclusion of certain variables (such as non-tracked activities or rare events) and the reliance on simplified assumptions for certain non-customer-facing tasks. In **Section 1.5**, the documentation mentions that some assumptions (e.g., around service levels, branch operating hours, and loan processing rates) will be updated annually or as needed based on business requirements. This ensures that the model remains flexible while relying on reasonable initial assumptions.

MRO reviewed the documented assumptions and limitations and found them appropriate given the complexity of forecasting staffing needs in a variable environment like retail banking. However, the lack of a formalized update mechanism (beyond "as needed") could lead to issues if significant changes in branch operations are not identified promptly. MRO suggests enhancing the update process with specific triggers or defined intervals for review.

The model documentation also states that outliers in transaction forecasts or service forecasts will trigger investigation by the WFP team (e.g., if teller forecasts are off by more than 5%). This escalation process provides additional assurance that assumptions will be revisited if model performance deviates significantly from observed data. MRO considers this process appropriate for maintaining model accuracy over time.

### Conclusion

The model developers described a methodology that appears appropriate for the business objective of staffing optimization within retail banking branches. The use of standard statistical methods, such as time-series forecasting and queuing theory, is reasonable for this purpose, and the choice of customized models for specific banking tasks is well-justified based on the documentation. MRO’s review of the documentation found that the assumptions and limitations are appropriate but recommends clearer processes for triggering updates to ensure continued accuracy. Additionally, while no regulatory conflicts were identified, further review of compliance with specific jurisdictional or accounting standards may be necessary.
