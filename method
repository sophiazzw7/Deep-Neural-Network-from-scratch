**Review of Model Methodology**

Based on the provided model documentation and analysis, the following assessment of the methodology is made:

Assessing the Model Approach:
The CloudCords model has been built to meet the objective of forecasting both customer-facing and non-customer-facing resource needs across various branch workgroups, such as Teller and Platform. The approach employs a time-series forecasting method, a queuing model, and a utilization model, ensuring it is capable of forecasting future branch activities and staffing needs.

Reasonableness of the Methodology:
The methodology uses historical transaction data, coupled with service-level agreements, to develop accurate forecasts. It draws upon industry-standard benchmarks and proprietary algorithms (e.g., proprietary Kiran algorithms for Teller and Banker activities) that are well-supported in practice. The queuing models applied for Teller and Platform workgroups are sound, addressing specific needs for wait time forecasting and resource allocation based on service demand. The segmentation between customer-facing and non-customer-facing activities reflects a deep understanding of branch operations.

Theoretical and Empirical Support:
The CloudCords model draws upon well-established principles in the banking industry, such as trend, seasonality, and inter-arrival time distributions, backed by historical transaction data and empirical field studies. For instance, field data from over 250 branches was used to validate the queuing models' performance, ensuring relevance and empirical backing. Additionally, proprietary modifications to the Holt-Winters time series model demonstrate empirical support, enhancing accuracy in low-volume environments.

Segmentation and Variable Selection:
The segmentation between customer-facing tasks, non-customer-facing tasks, and transaction types (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, account openings) is reasonable and aligned with the business objective. The time standards assigned to different transaction types, combined with branch configurations (e.g., Teller and Platform workgroups), ensure adequate segmentation of activity, critical for resource forecasting.

Model Logic and Assumptions:
The assumptions underlying the model, such as the use of time standards for each transaction type and the queuing models' service-level focus, are reasonable and justified. Field data confirms the validity of the assumptions used, such as the assumption of Poisson arrivals for Teller service and service-level standards for Banker activities. Additionally, adjustments based on industry standards, such as the handling of outliers and non-standard transactions, are documented, adding to the robustness of the methodology.

Consistency with Regulatory and Industry Standards:
The model methodology aligns with industry practices for staffing and resource forecasting, particularly for the retail banking environment. While no specific regulatory requirements were cited in the documentation, the use of industry-accepted time standards and service level expectations reflects adherence to common financial services practices.

Qualitative Judgmental Assumptions:
The assumptions in the model (e.g., absorption of non-customer-facing tasks during idle time, application of different service level targets) appear reasonable and supported by empirical data from the field studies. The division between Teller, Banker, and non-customer-facing tasks reflects judgment that matches operational requirements.

Data Quality and Completeness:
As outlined in Section 4, the data used in the model appears sound, with no missing or incomplete data observed. The historical data and transaction volumes, sourced from Truist's mainframe systems, provide a reliable basis for the methodology. Data transformations and mapping (e.g., mapping transactions to forecast groups and time standard groups) are detailed and comprehensive, ensuring data relevancy and appropriateness.

Assumptions and Limitations:
The model's limitations, such as reliance on industry-standard time standards and assumptions regarding queue behavior, are identified and properly addressed. Sensitivity to specific branch conditions (e.g., urban vs. rural branches, transaction mix differences) is acknowledged and incorporated into the segmentation of resource forecasting. Furthermore, the analysis comparing the CloudCords model to the Erlang-C model demonstrates the appropriateness of the assumptions related to transaction volumes and resource distribution across different branch sizes.

Assessment of Alternative Methodologies:
The documentation provides a comparison between different approaches to staffing forecasting, such as productivity standards, work-content-driven approaches, and traditional queuing models. Each method is evaluated for its advantages and limitations, with the CloudCords model favoring a queuing-based approach for Teller services and a utilization-based model for Banker services. This assessment highlights the superior performance of the CloudCords model in capturing the complexity of banking operations, especially in low-volume branches.

Conclusion:
The CloudCords model's methodology is well-supported by empirical data, appropriate assumptions, and alignment with business objectives. The queuing models and forecasting approaches are logical, well-founded, and capable of producing reasonable resource forecasts for branch operations. Based on the documentation and analysis, the model approach and methodology meet the requirements for both operational efficiency and alignment with industry standards.
