Assess if the quality, completeness, and reasonableness of data used to develop the method are good, along with data assumptions:

Based on the assessment of model input in Section 4, MRO has identified that the data sources used in the model (such as the Teller Transaction System, Client Central, and historical transaction volumes) appear relevant and appropriate for the forecasting task at hand. However, several critical elements were found to be missing or insufficiently documented, which could impact the overall assessment of data quality, completeness, and reasonableness.

The documentation does provide details on data aggregation and transformation processes, specifically how transactions are mapped into time standard groups and how certain anomalies in the data (e.g., excessively long or short sessions) are handled. However, the following key areas were found lacking:

Data Dictionary: A detailed data dictionary describing the variables used, their creation rules, formats, and decoding rules is not included. This limits the transparency and traceability of data processing.
Descriptive Statistics and Outlier Analysis: The documentation lacks a comprehensive analysis of variable distributions, outliers, and missing values, which is necessary for assessing data integrity and consistency.
Handling of Missing or Corrupted Data: The approach to handling missing or corrupted data is not well documented, leaving a gap in understanding how incomplete data is addressed.
Advanced Data Transformation and Sampling: There is no mention of advanced transformation techniques (such as normalization or clustering) or of any sampling or partitioning methodologies applied to the dataset for model development.
In light of these observations, MRO concludes that while the data sources are aligned with the modelâ€™s objectives, the quality, completeness, and reasonableness of the data cannot be fully confirmed without further documentation and analysis in the areas mentioned above. Specifically, MRO recommends the inclusion of the following in the documentation to enhance the assessment of data quality:

A detailed data dictionary,
Descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical variables,
A clear explanation of the methodology used to handle missing and outlier data, and
Documentation of any data partitioning or sampling methods employed.
Without these enhancements, MRO cannot definitively conclude that the data used to develop the method is of sufficient quality and completeness, as several key aspects of the data processing and validation remain unclear.

### **4. Review of Data Quality and Data Appropriateness**

#### **4.1 Summary of Data Processing**

**Data Sources**  
The data sources used in the model are partially documented in **Section 1.8 (Development Data Sources)**. It provides an overview of the teller, platform, and universal transaction volumes. It mentions:
- **Teller transactions** are traced from specific system sources (BB&T PC Teller System and Enterprise Teller System) and cover 24 months of historical data.
- **Platform/Universal Sales and Service Volumes** are derived from BB&T Client Central and other internal systems, also spanning 24 months.
- **Non-Customer Facing Activities** are based on standard activities such as ATM servicing, vault balancing, and coaching.

However, the documentation **does not provide a complete data dictionary** or **data creation rules** for each variable used in the model.

- **F_0001**: Please include a detailed data dictionary with descriptions of all variables, the variable creation rules, source data fields, units, decoding rules for categorical variables, and basic descriptive statistics.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
The process of **data aggregation and transformation** is outlined in **Section 1.11 (Data Aggregation and Transformations)**. Each dataset (e.g., Teller Transactions, DEP Sales) goes through a mapping process, aligning transactions to forecast and time-standard groups. It also describes the removal of unneeded transactions, such as **night deposits**.

The documentation includes **examples of data anomalies** in **Section 1.12** (e.g., excessively long teller sessions) and outlines how these anomalies are excluded from the model. This ensures a certain level of data cleaning is performed. However, there is no mention of how missing or corrupted data is handled beyond these exclusions.

- **F_0002**: Please provide details about how missing, corrupted, or incomplete data is handled in the data cleaning process.

**Code Documentation**  
The documentation does not currently provide information on the specific code used to process data. Without code references, the traceability of the data transformation process is limited.

- **F_0003**: Please provide documentation of the code used to process source data into final model development datasets.

#### **4.2 Data Quality Assessment**

**Descriptive Analysis**  
There is no mention in the documentation of descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for the variables used in the model. The assessment of variable distribution, including identifying outliers, high concentrations, or missing values, is not documented.

- **F_0004**: Please provide descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for continuous variables, and frequency distribution for categorical variables used in the model.
- **F_0005**: Please include an analysis of outliers and missing values, along with the treatment methodology.

**Duplicated or Missing Data**  
While **Section 1.12** mentions the exclusion of certain records due to anomalies, the documentation does not provide a complete assessment of duplicated or missing values for each variable. Additionally, the methodology for handling these cases is not fully described.

- **F_0006**: Please provide an analysis of duplicated or missing values for each variable, and document the methodology for addressing these issues.

**Consistency Check**  
There is no documentation related to consistency checks for the variables (e.g., ensuring that "age" values are within a sensible range or ensuring that FICO scores aren't negative). While the model uses internal data sources, no documentation ensures that basic consistency checks are applied.

- **F_0007**: Please document any consistency checks performed on the data, ensuring that variables fall within reasonable ranges and values.

**Data Source Evaluation**  
The data sources (e.g., BB&T PC Teller System, Client Central) are from internal systems, but there is no explicit documentation of the reliability or representativeness of these sources in terms of meeting the model objectives. Additionally, there is no mention of any external data sources or validation against external benchmarks.

- **F_0008**: Please provide documentation evaluating the reliability and representativeness of the data sources and whether external validation (if applicable) was considered.

#### **4.3 Data Appropriateness Assessment**

**Data Cleaning Process**  
Section **1.11** provides some details about removing unneeded transactions and aggregating data, but the documentation lacks a more detailed explanation of how data outliers are treated, or how incorrect or corrupted data is fixed. Furthermore, there is no reference to backfilling missing data or addressing incomplete records beyond anomaly exclusion.

- **F_0009**: Please provide a detailed explanation of the data cleaning process, including treatment for corrupted, incorrect, and incomplete data. Mention any specific procedures for backfilling missing data, if applicable.

**Data Transformation**  
The documentation outlines basic data transformations, such as mapping transactions to time standards and forecast groups in **Section 1.11**. However, there is no mention of advanced transformations, such as normalization, clustering, or binning, that may be relevant for this kind of model.

- **F_0010**: Please document any additional data transformation techniques applied, such as normalization, clustering, or binning.

**Data Relevance and Sampling**  
While the model documentation explains the data sources and their relevance for the tasks being modeled, there is no discussion of whether any sampling or re-sampling techniques were applied (e.g., partitioning data into training and validation sets). Given the large dataset (24 months of historical data), this is a notable omission.

- **F_0011**: Please provide information on whether any sampling, re-sampling, or data partitioning methodologies were used and document their appropriateness for the model development process.

**Statistical Validity of Data Assumptions**  
The documentation does not provide explicit statistical validation for the assumptions made about the data, such as ensuring the representativeness of historical data for forecasting future transactions. Without this, it is unclear whether the underlying assumptions about the data's appropriateness for the model objectives were tested.

- **F_0012**: Please provide statistical validation for the assumptions made about the representativeness and appropriateness of the data, particularly in relation to forecasting future transactions.
