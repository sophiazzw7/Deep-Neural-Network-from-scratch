Below are two sample emails you can adapt for your needs—one regarding your PERM application address update, and one regarding your current H-1B address update. Be sure to verify any specific filing requirements (like Form AR-11 for USCIS) and timelines to remain compliant with U.S. immigration regulations.

## **Email 1: PERM Application Address Update**

**Subject:** Address Change Notification – [Your Name], PERM Application

**Dear [Officer Name or Department/Team Handling PERM Applications],**

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you that I will be moving to a new address effective **January 27**. My new address will be:

## **Email 2: H-1B Visa Address Update**

**Subject:** Address Change Notification – [Your Name], H-1B Visa

**Dear [Officer Name or USCIS Contact/Employer’s Immigration Specialist],**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to notify you that my address will be changing on **January 27**. My new residence address is:

```
1119 Apogee Dr
Durham, NC 27713
```

I currently hold an H-1B visa, and I would like to make sure all necessary records and documentation reflect this change of address to avoid any issues with future correspondence or notifications.

**Please advise if I need to complete any forms** (such as an AR-11 for USCIS) or take any additional actions to update my address for my H-1B status. I appreciate your guidance and assistance.

**Thank you**, and please feel free to reach out if you need any additional information.

**Sincerely,**  
[Your Name]  
[Your Contact Information]

### **Additional Tips:**
- If you are directly emailing a specific officer at USCIS (which is uncommon unless you have a direct point of contact or a case-specific email), you would typically file an **AR-11** form online (or by mail) to update your address with USCIS.  
- If you are working with your employer’s HR or immigration attorney, forward these notifications to them first so they can advise or assist with any additional requirements.  
- Keep a copy of any emails or letters you send for your own records.
