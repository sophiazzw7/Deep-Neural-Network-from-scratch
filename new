### Model Performance Report (2020 Summary)

#### **1. Overview**
The model is designed to forecast transactions and sales to provide recommendations for staffing schedules across branches. Actual vs. forecast data is monitored monthly, with thresholds set at <5% error for teller transactions and <20% for platform transactions. The model is essential in ensuring operational effectiveness and scheduling optimization.

#### **2. Performance in 2020**
In 2020, there were notable events impacting model performance:
- **BB&T and SunTrust Merger**: As part of the ongoing integration, the merger had a direct impact on branch operations and transaction data. The model had to accommodate changes as operations across branches were consolidated and client-facing operations merged.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic**: This caused significant disruptions in branch operations, such as closures and shifts in client behavior, resulting in substantial deviations from historical transaction patterns.

#### **3. 2020 Performance Review**
- **Actual vs. Forecast Accuracy**: Throughout 2020, there were months where forecast accuracy exceeded the <5% threshold for teller transactions and <20% threshold for platform transactions.
    - **Teller Transactions**: "The OGM team will monitor the actuals vs forecast a minimum of 12 times per year or once a month. OGM includes the performance baseline of <5% threshold for teller and <20% threshold for platform across all branches."
    - **Platform Transactions**: "If the performance baseline threshold is not met, the OGM will investigate to determine causes. Transaction and sales forecasts will be monitored and outliers will be identified."

#### **4. No Findings Issued in 2020**
- Despite exceeding thresholds, no findings were issued for the following reasons:
    - **External Events**: The deviations were attributed to external, uncontrollable events like the merger and the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which led to temporary but significant changes in transaction patterns.
        - "The model generates staffing recommendations based upon inputs. These include data from heritage banks (B&T in 2018 and BB&T in 2020) and are impacted by major disruptions such as COVID-19."
    - **Model Structure**: Internal reviews confirmed that the model was still functioning correctly, and the variances were directly tied to the external events rather than a flaw in the model itself.
        - "Model owner and model users are able to compare the forecast with actual transactions and sales. The forecast vs actual will verify the validity of the model."
    - **Recovery to Normal Operations**: As operations normalized post-pandemic and merger, model performance returned to within acceptable ranges.
        - "The forecast is paramount to the success of the scheduler. The forecast will drive the number of hours scheduled in a branch along with when they are scheduled to have face-to-face client interaction."

#### **5. Actions Taken**
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Despite the variances, the OGM process remained in place, ensuring continuous performance monitoring.
