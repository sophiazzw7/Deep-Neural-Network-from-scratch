The benchmarking analysis, as described in the MDD, acknowledges the challenge of comparing ZORS against external models due to its central role in the decisioning process. Given that ZORS itself drives approval or decline decisions, any comparison with other models will inherently suffer from selection bias. Despite this, PLRS (MOD11827) was selected as a benchmark due to data availability and comparable rank-ordering capability.

For both 2024Q2 and 2024Q4, the discrimination power of ZORS remains consistently stronger than the benchmark PLRS across all loan purpose segments. In Q2, ZORS AUCs exceed PLRS AUCs by a meaningful margin in all categories, with the overall AUC for ZORS at 0.7281 versus 0.6889 for PLRS. A similar result holds in Q4, where the ZORS model again outperforms across the board, and the KS statistics also show ZORS maintaining higher discriminatory power.

Although the ZORS model was trained on a shorter performance window than ideal (18 months vs. a longer comparison horizon recommended in the MDD), the difference in AUC and KS remains material and consistently in favor of ZORS. As such, the benchmarking results are considered acceptable and continue to support the modelâ€™s validity in rank ordering applicants.
