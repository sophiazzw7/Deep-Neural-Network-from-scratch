I have included three Excel files:

2024Q4: Contains raw facility-level attributes.

2025Q1: Contains the updated facility attributes for the following quarter.

25Q1_24Q4_Analysis.xlsx: Contains pivot tables and comparative analysis between quarters.

Within these files:

Tabs such as 2024Q4_pivot1 and 2025Q1_pivot1 summarize weighted utilization, commitment, drawn amount, and count of accounts by risk rating.

Tabs pivot2 in both quarters provide a matrix view of utilization distribution across risk ratings.

The Analysis tab provides a time-series comparison of utilization change grouped by risk migration (downgrade, unchanged, upgrade). For example, utilization increases among upgraded accounts and decreases slightly among downgraded accounts.

No conclusions are drawn here; these tables are meant to support further interpretation.
