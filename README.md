The developer subsequently provided a detailed root cause analysis for overrides tagged under “Other Collateral Strengths” across 2024Q2 to 2025Q1. The analysis showed that overrides were driven by a range of facility-specific factors. In 2024Q2, reasons included cross-collateralization with other ABL facilities, high recovery rates for dealer finance receivables, annual inventory appraisals and field exams, PPP guarantees, and certain cases where collateral performed well despite not being appraised. Some overrides also related to unsecured exposures where collateral was housed under the current facility but not fully recognized in model inputs. Similar themes carried into 2024Q3 and 2024Q4, with additional references to strong receivables from well-known companies and semi-annual rolling stock appraisals. In 2025Q1, explanations again included cross-collateralization, dealer finance receivables, and monitoring practices, as well as a case involving a supply chain finance facility where Truist retained the right to obtain security.

In their response, the developer clarified that the override reason “Other Collateral Strengths” is not intended to capture guarantees only. While some overrides did involve PPP loans or government guarantees, these represented a small share of the total. For example, of 44 overrides in 2024Q2, only nine were related to PPP loans and government guarantees, and those cases involved obligors from the same parent company. The developer emphasized that most overrides captured other facility-specific collateral factors, such as monitoring results and appraisal practices, rather than guarantees alone.

The developer also noted that unsecured loans can appear within the ABL segment, representing about 5–6 percent of collateralized exposures. These unsecured items explain why some facilities initially received lower LGD grades despite being within the ABL portfolio. MRO reviewed these explanations and performed its own analysis of repeat override patterns and rating outcomes. While the explanations aligned with observed facility conditions, MRO noted that many overrides reflected gaps in the current LGD model design. Specifically, the model does not always capture cross-collateralized exposures at the outset, relies heavily on point-in-time borrowing base utilization, and may not fully incorporate the recovery characteristics of dealer finance receivables. These design gaps lead to a systematic pattern of overrides rather than isolated judgment calls.

MRO raised these concerns with the developer, noting that overrides often reflect better knowledge of collateral or monitoring results that the current model framework cannot fully incorporate. MRO concluded that these issues point to structural limitations of the model. However, no new risk item was raised, as these weaknesses are already covered under Archer finding FND-15446005, which requires redevelopment of the LGD scorecard.
