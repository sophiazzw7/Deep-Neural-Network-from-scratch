MROâ€™s independent reviews of the 2024Q2 and 2024Q4 production datasets concluded that the data is appropriate for performance monitoring and model validation of MOD13512. Key input variables conformed to expected business ranges, target labels were correctly populated, and no duplicate records were found. Missing values were limited, stable across quarters, and aligned with business logic. While some fields such as CHARGEOFFAMOUNT showed recurring omissions among defaults, these gaps do not affect model input but may impact downstream reporting. Overall, the data meets the quality and structural standards required for second-line oversight.
