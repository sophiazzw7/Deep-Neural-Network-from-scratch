MRO reviewed the LGD risk rating distributions for 2024Q2 through 2025Q1. The distributions showed differences between model and final ratings, with final ratings assigning higher percentages in certain grades compared with the model. For example, in multiple quarters the final ratings had a higher percentage of exposures in Grade C compared with the model results. Grade B percentages in the final ratings were generally lower than those produced by the model. Other grades, including D through I, remained relatively consistent between model and final ratings, with only minor differences observed.

MRO noted that these results were consistent with the override activity observed in OGM testing. The differences between model and final distributions reflected sustained adjustments made through the override process.
