Hi Alex,

Thank you for the update — noted on the task being FSV instead of AV.

Also, following up on our 1:1 last week when you looped in Mike: we discussed the model’s planned rebuild timeline of October 1, 2026, and you mentioned you would follow up with the model owner/user. How did that conversation go?

Regarding your question, there will be some rework needed on my side. I’ve been working on the annual review scope and template, and I also have another model in progress, but I can shift to the methodology, assumptions, and additional testing needed for the FSV work. With the current target close date of December 12, would it be possible to request a two-week extension? I want to make sure I can give this model the right level of attention while still keeping up with the Operational Risk model and my other assignment.

Please let me know if that works.
Thank you,
Phoebe
