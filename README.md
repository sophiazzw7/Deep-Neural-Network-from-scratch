The PRISM Wholesale LGD ABL scorecard is employed to assign facility-level LGD ratings to credit exposures within the Asset Based Lending (ABL) portfolio and Non-ABL Borrowing Base facilities. The scorecard was originally intended for exclusive use by the ABL group within the CIB line of business. In 2023, the model’s scope was expanded following Audit Issue FND-14377498 to include Non-ABL borrowing base facilities, also referred to as Secured Finance.

As of Q1 2025, the model covers approximately 301 ABL and Non-ABL Borrowing Base facilities, with $3.5B outstanding loan balance and $12.9B in exposures.

Secured Finance portfolios are defined as non-ABL borrowing base revolvers that are secured by working capital assets but rely on the borrower’s cash flow for repayment rather than collateral liquidation. Key distinctions include:

ABL facilities involve high-intensity collateral monitoring (e.g., field exams, cash dominion) and assume repayment through collateral liquidation, with collateral valued at Net Orderly Liquidation Value (NOLV).

SF facilities have moderate collateral oversight and are intended to be repaid through ongoing operations. Collateral is typically valued at Net Book Value (NBV), with more conservative advance rates (e.g., A/R up to 80%, inventory up to 50%).
