MRO reviewed the Sheffield PAG modelâ€™s documentation, methodology, assumptions, data controls, and available evidence. The model framework is conceptually sound, and input data are supported by documented reconciliation and quality checks.

Because there have been no PAG deals since 2019, MRO was unable to conduct performance testing in recent OGM periods. As no issues were identified in documentation review and model design, MRO assesses the model as Fit for Use.

The U.S. economy in 2025 shows slower growth, easing labor markets, and persistent inflation. Since the model excludes macroeconomic drivers in paydown estimation and does not capture post-COVID or recent downturn data, it may be less responsive to rising defaults or weaker paydowns under stress. Future redevelopment should incorporate updated data to address these gaps.
