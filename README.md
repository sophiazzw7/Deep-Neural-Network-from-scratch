Certain key borrower attributes were not available during earlier periods of model estimation. For example, origination LTV is not available prior to June 2010, while origination term length and product category are largely missing prior to 2014. As a result, the dataset used for model development does not provide a strong capture of borrower performance during the last recession. This limitation may reduce the modelâ€™s ability to fully reflect borrower behavior and responsiveness under stressed economic conditions. MRO noted that it would be advantageous to refresh the model once sufficient data becomes available in order to ensure stronger coverage of downturn performance. However, given the absence or limited volume of PAG deals since 2019, a model refresh is currently not feasible. MRO therefore recommends refreshing the model when deal volume resumes and adequate data are available to reassess sensitivity under economic downturn conditions.
