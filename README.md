Thank you for confirming that the OGM cadence has been increased in line with the action plan. However, since the model has not been performing as intended for five consecutive quarters, and no compensating measures are currently in place, MRO is concerned that increased monitoring alone may not sufficiently mitigate the risk associated with continued use of the model. We wanted to check if there are any interim actions or controls the user can implement to help manage risk exposure prior to redevelopment completion in Dec 2026.

Additionally, we reviewed the deck you shared, and noted it was dated March 2024 and focused on analyzing the 2023Q4 override breach. Could you let us know if any further root cause analysis has been conducted for the 2024Q1 through 2025Q1 breaches? In particular, weâ€™re interested in whether any override patterns, trends, or recurring drivers have been identified.
