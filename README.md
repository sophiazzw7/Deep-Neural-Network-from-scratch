The Sheffield PAG model is used for pricing and valuation of Sheffield PAG loans.

The model forecasts future payment default and prepayment risks under forecasted economic conditions.

The methodology relies on Vantage Score 4.0 and TU Bankruptcy Score, which were included as risk drivers during model development.

The model applies a hazard framework to estimate monthly default and paydown rates, as documented in the model methodology section.

Since 2019, there have been limited or no Sheffield PAG deals originated. As a result, OGM reports for 2022Q2, 2022Q4, 2023Q4, and 2024Q4 contained no PAG data and therefore did not produce monitoring results.

During this annual review, MRO requested the developer to confirm expected volumes with the Line of Business. The LOB reported that annual PAG production is expected to be approximately $50 million.
