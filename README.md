I am on track to meet or exceed my established performance goals this year. I have maintained strong alignment with Enterprise Issues Management and Internal Controls policies, ensuring timely identification and remediation of issues. I successfully contributed to the CCAR effort by following updated procedures, independently testing model outputs, and effectively challenging model effectiveness where appropriate. I also reviewed Archer findings and supported remediation planning to address control gaps. Through these efforts, I’ve helped maintain issue health, improve control execution, and reinforce sound risk management practices across my assigned areas.

I consistently demonstrate Truist’s core values of Trustworthy, Caring, One Team, and Success in my daily work and interactions. I proactively identify and escalate risks, follow through on remediation responsibilities, and maintain accountability for control execution—reflecting integrity, ownership, and risk awareness. I collaborated effectively on the CCAR effort and Archer remediation reviews, and I independently challenged model effectiveness through testing and analysis.

In support of the One Team and Caring values, I mentored a new teammate by helping them onboard and navigate internal tools and processes. I also regularly assist colleagues with Python coding, sharing technical knowledge to help them resolve issues more efficiently. These actions have strengthened team collaboration, fostered a learning environment, and supported our collective success.


 have demonstrated strong awareness and execution of risk management practices in my role as a model validator. I consistently identify data and modeling risks early by thoroughly reviewing model documentation, development processes, and performance metrics. I proactively challenge model effectiveness when gaps are identified and escalate concerns in a timely and constructive manner.

For example, I contributed to the CCAR validation effort by reviewing test procedures against updated regulatory guidance, identifying inconsistencies in threshold justification, and communicating findings clearly to model developers. I supported timely remediation through follow-up meetings and collaborative resolution, ensuring issues were addressed before submission deadlines. I’ve also maintained compliance with risk-related training and policy expectations.

Overall, I approach validation responsibilities with diligence, precision, and a strong sense of accountability, ensuring models are not only technically sound but aligned with enterprise risk appetite and regulatory expectations.



Over the past six months, I have actively sought opportunities to grow both technically and professionally. I proactively asked my manager for opportunities to support Python-based model validations, which allowed me to enhance my technical skills while contributing meaningfully to the team’s efficiency. I’ve supported teammates by troubleshooting code, sharing reusable scripts, and helping streamline validation testing.

In addition to hands-on learning, I’ve taken the initiative to mentor a new team member, helping them understand our validation standards, tools, and internal processes. I also regularly seek feedback to improve the clarity and effectiveness of my documentation and communication with model developers.

Looking ahead, I plan to continue building my Python and model performance analysis skills and expand into machine learning model validations. I’m also interested in strengthening my ability to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders, helping bridge risk awareness across functions.
