Hi [Team],

Thanks for confirming. I’ve also checked with Mary and the governance team but wasn’t able to locate the original MCA form either. In this case, we’d recommend re-submitting the MCA.

Additionally, the MDD mentions that the model covered “~$1B in PAG deals annually prior to 2019” with limited or no PAG deals since. Could you advise on the expected model coverage going forward? It may be worth aligning with the model owner or user to determine whether PAG volumes are expected to resume, or whether coverage should be revised.

Happy to discuss further if helpful.

Best,
Phoebe
