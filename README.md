MRO also noted that 886 defaulted loans lacked a recorded CHARGEOFFAMOUNT. These cases represent approximately 23% of all defaults in Q2 and are consistent with recurring data lags between servicing systems and the production data feed. While CHARGEOFFAMOUNT is not used as an input to the MOD13512 model, these omissions may limit the completeness of downstream reporting and impact interpretation of loss-based metrics in OGM deliverables.. These cases represent approximately 23% of all defaults in Q2 and are consistent with recurring data lags between servicing systems and the production data feed.


In Q2 and Q4 respectively, 886 and 1,043 defaulted loans lacked CHARGEOFFAMOUNT values. While this field is not used in the MOD13512 model itself, the recurring omission may affect completeness of loss-based metrics in OGM reporting and highlights the importance of robust upstream data controls.


MRO also noted that 1043 defaulted accounts lacked a recorded CHARGEOFFAMOUNT. These cases represent approximately 18% of all defaults and reflect known lags in data transmission between servicing systems and downstream reporting structures.‚Äù

While the overall data structure and content remain appropriate for model performance monitoring, MRO notes that the consistency of missingness patterns and data anomalies across quarters underscores the importance of robust first-line data controls. The model development team should establish formalized monitoring and reconciliation checks to validate the integrity of production scoring files prior to use. These controls should ensure timely and complete ingestion of all required fields, particularly for delinquency history and charge-off attributes, to safeguard downstream model performance and reporting accuracy.
