Backtesting is designed to evaluate the accuracy of the model’s predicted amounts for defaults and paydowns. The metric used is the relative error, 

(Actual−Predicted)/Actual, which is monitored at multiple forecast horizons (3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). Errors are measured using static pools defined as all loans in the portfolio at a given date, and multiple overlapping intervals are applied to minimize the risk of mischaracterized performance. The average error across overlapping intervals is reported as mean bias error (MBE). MBE was selected because it measures the systematic error of forecasts, indicating whether the model consistently over- or under-predicts.
