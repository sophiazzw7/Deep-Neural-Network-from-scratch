I have consistently demonstrated effective risk management behaviors in my daily work. I stay current on applicable risk policies and training, and I actively identify potential issues during model validation reviews. I communicate concerns clearly with stakeholders and escalate when needed to ensure timely resolution. For example, I’ve raised questions about model assumptions and testing logic during validation and worked collaboratively to address them. I also ensure that my documentation is clear and complete to support audit readiness and internal transparency.


Over the past six months, I have actively sought opportunities to grow both technically and professionally. I proactively asked my manager for opportunities to support Python-based model validations, which allowed me to enhance my technical skills while contributing meaningfully to the team’s efficiency. I’ve supported teammates by troubleshooting code, sharing reusable scripts, and helping streamline validation testing.

In addition to hands-on learning, I’ve taken the initiative to mentor a new team member, helping them understand our validation standards, tools, and internal processes. I also regularly seek feedback to improve the clarity and effectiveness of my documentation and communication with model developers.

Looking ahead, I plan to continue building my Python and model performance analysis skills and expand into machine learning model validations. I’m also interested in strengthening my ability to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders, helping bridge risk awareness across functions.
