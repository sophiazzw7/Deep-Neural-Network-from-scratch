Hi Amit,

Thank you for your response and for sharing the guarantor “lift to recovery on leftover exposure” table. I had a few follow-ups based on our review discussion:

The table indicates a 5% LGD even when no guarantee is present. Could you explain why the value is not zero in this case?

More broadly, could you provide a worked example to illustrate how the “lift to recovery on leftover exposure” is applied in practice? For example, how the lift interacts with the starting LGD, collateral recovery assumptions, and the definition of “leftover exposure.”

Regarding your explanation that some G–K ratings are tied to non-ABL borrowing bases: based on the OGM reports, material overrides in non-ABL segments appear limited (generally only 1–2 per monitoring period). This does not seem to account for the full set of overrides. For instance, in the analysis Jiao shared, the overrides were labeled as ABL, and showed 26 G–K overrides in 2024Q2, 13 in 2024Q3, 11 in 2024Q4, and 14 in 2025Q1. Could you clarify this point?

We would like to incorporate your clarifications into the performance section of our report.
