Based on the model documentation and the most recent OGM results, MRO reviewed the continued reasonableness of the model approach for the ABL and Borrowing Base LGD scorecard. Because this is an annual review, MRO focused on the model’s use and performance through OGM testing and did not conduct a comprehensive review of methodology as would be performed in a full scope validation.

The model approach defines Exposure at Default (EAD) separately for term loans and revolver facilities. Term Loan EAD is calculated from commitment amounts and applies Loan Equivalency Factors that vary by product type, with 100 percent for term loans and financial letters of credit, 50 percent for performance letters of credit, and 25 percent for trade letters of credit. Revolver EAD is calculated as the greater of 95 percent of the Net Total Group Borrowing Base after adjusting for blocks and reserves, or the sum of total revolver outstanding and pari passu outstanding amounts. Total Group EAD remains capped at Truist’s total commitment, including pari passu commitments.

Recoverable Collateral Value (RCV) is derived from collateral values and recovery rate parameters differentiated by collateral type and valuation method. These recovery parameters were adapted from the Legacy General Facility Model and include values for cash, receivables, inventory, equipment, vehicles, real estate, intellectual property, and unsecured exposures. RCV values differ by valuation method, including Net Forced Liquidation Value, Net Orderly Liquidation Value, Fair Market Value, and Net Book Value. Multiplicative control adjustors are then applied to reflect the degree of collateral control, ranging from 110 percent for monitored and perfected security interests down to 50 percent for unsecured exposures.

The model also incorporates adjustments for senior claims, which are subtracted from collateral recoveries when facilities share obligations, and guarantees, such as SBA guarantees or support agreements, which increase recovery on unsecured exposures. The unsecured base recovery rate is set at 5 percent when no guarantees are present. Loss Given Default (LGD) is calculated from secured recoveries, unsecured recoveries, and reserves relative to total EAD, with floors and caps applied to align with expert judgment. Because there has been a lack of defaults in the ABL portfolio since 2007, the model relies on an expert opinion scorecard rather than a fully quantitative model.

While this framework is established in the model documentation, MRO’s annual review centered on the actual performance observed in recent OGM testing. MRO noted consecutive material override breaches across the four most recent quarters, with a concentration of overrides in the upgrade direction rather than downgrades. Overrides were consistently concentrated in the reason code “Other Collateral Strengths.” MRO independently stacked override events across the four quarters from 2024Q2 through 2025Q1 and observed persistence of repeat overrides at both the event and obligor level. This independent analysis showed that a significant portion of overrides repeated across quarters, which raised concern about sustained reliance on overrides in the model’s application.

To further understand this pattern, MRO reached out to the developer on two occasions. The first request asked Model Development to replicate the repeat override analysis and provide counts at the event and obligor level. The developer confirmed MRO’s results, reporting that approximately 60 to 70 percent of material overrides were upgrades, with most attributed to the reason code “Other Collateral Strengths.” They further reported that across four quarters there were 69 unique rating events with 34 repeat overrides, resulting in a 49 percent event-level impact, and 50 unique obligors with 15 repeat obligors, resulting in a 30 percent obligor-level impact.

In a second follow-up, MRO requested a decomposition of the “Other Collateral Strengths” reason code. The developer provided specific examples by quarter. In 2024Q2, drivers included cross-collateralization, high recovery rates for dealer finance receivables, ABL monitoring and advance rates, annual inventory appraisals and field exams, PPP guarantees, collateral performing without being appraised, rapid liquidation of unappraised inventory, mark-to-market exposures reserved from the borrowing base, and unsecured exposures treated as collateralized. In 2024Q3, examples included cross-collateralization, high recovery rates for dealer finance receivables, unsecured exposures housed at the current or collateral inputs for the current, accounts receivable from a well-known company considered above average collateral, semi-annual rolling stock appraisals, and collateral appraised at 14,332M OLV. In 2024Q4, similar themes were noted, including cross-collateralization, dealer finance receivables, rolling stock appraisals, collateral appraised at 14,332M OLV, and collateral performance without appraisal. In 2025Q1, examples included cross-collateralization, high recovery rates for dealer finance receivables, semi-annual rolling stock appraisals, unsecured exposures housed at the current or collateral inputs for the current, and an SCF facility not reserved but with Truist retaining the right to obtain security upon notice.

These developer responses confirmed MRO’s independent observations that the majority of overrides are upgrades tied to collateral characteristics not fully captured by the scorecard. The persistence and concentration of these overrides suggest that the current LGD scorecard continues to rely on rater adjustments to address collateral-specific factors at origination.

MRO considered whether a new risk item should be raised to capture this issue. However, MRO determined that a duplicative risk item is not necessary because an existing Archer finding already covers the issue. Archer finding FND-15446005, titled “BU – CR – ABL & Borrowing Base LGD Scorecard Refresh/Redesign,” was self-identified and is currently in remediation. This finding specifies that the ABL and Borrowing Base LGD scorecard experienced a significant number of overrides that resulted in sustained metric breaches not expected to cure. The escalation plan requires the model to be refreshed or redesigned to bring overrides within tolerance. The root cause documented in the Archer finding states that the model was designed using expert opinion and moved from a non-model to model status in MIMS, requiring greater rigor. Regulatory feedback also lowered the override threshold, which amplified the sustained breach. The planned remediation includes a full review of developmental evidence and model redesign to address high override rates.

Because this active Archer finding already addresses the sustained override issue, MRO has aligned its observations to FND-15446005 rather than opening a new risk item. MRO will continue to monitor override persistence and concentrations in future OGM results and will track progress against the remediation commitments under the Archer finding.
