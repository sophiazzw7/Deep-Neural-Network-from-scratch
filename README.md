I was reviewing the documentation and saw that it references two reconciliation processes: the RED-C GL-Recon performed by Treasury DO and the quality control checks on macroeconomic scenarios by RQCRA. Would it be possible for you to share any reconciliation reports or artifacts related to these data quality control checks?
