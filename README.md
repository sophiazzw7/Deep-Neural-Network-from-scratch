Hi Rebecca — quick question. In MOD1497 the LGD formula uses recoveries (ROS + ROU), but it doesn’t discount them for timing or add collection costs. That looks more like accounting loss than economic loss. Just to confirm, what’s the general practice here — do we usually define LGD/LTD for risk rating on an accounting basis, or as an economic loss (with discounting and costs) as policy suggests?
