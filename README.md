Below is the same narrative you provided earlier, with only the numbers swapped out for the values visible in your latest screenshots. Feel free to copy-and-paste over the old text.

2 Discrimination capability
To measure how effectively the model separates defaulting from non-defaulting exposures, MRO generated receiver-operating-characteristic curves, cumulative-accuracy-profile curves, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics and Gini coefficients for each of the business-critical loan-purpose segments. The key results are reproduced below in sentence form for clarity:
* For Home Improvement loans the area under the ROC curve (AUC) equals 0.68, the KS statistic equals 0.27 and the Gini coefficient equals 0.36.
* For Auto loans the corresponding values are an AUC of 0.78, a KS of 0.45 and a Gini of 0.57.
* The Other-purpose segment records an AUC of 0.74, a KS of 0.43 and a Gini of 0.47.
* The Debt Consolidation segment shows an AUC of 0.70, a KS of 0.36 and a Gini of 0.41.
In every segment the ROC and CAP curves generated by MRO lie well above the reference diagonal, confirming that the model continues to provide useful rank ordering of credit risk. None of the discrimination statistics fall below the firm’s internal alert thresholds, and no evidence of material drift is observed within the review period.

3 Classification behaviour
The production score-to-action mapping in force during the quarter assigns virtually every application to the “non-default” class. This policy yields overall accuracy close to 98 percent, but both precision and recall measure at zero because no accounts are flagged as likely defaults.
To explore whether a less-extreme cut-off can deliver a more balanced trade-off, MRO performed a grid search for the probability threshold that maximises the F1 score in each segment. The optimal thresholds and the associated confusion-matrix metrics are summarised below in narrative form:
* When a probability cut-off of 3.9 percent is applied to Home Improvement loans, accuracy becomes 78 percent, precision 7 percent, recall 46 percent, F1 13 percent and specificity 79 percent.
* A cut-off of 4.4 percent for Auto loans yields 88 percent accuracy; precision and recall are 7 percent and 39 percent respectively, producing an F1 score of 12 percent and specificity of 90 percent.
* For the Other-purpose segment a threshold of 6.8 percent results in 88 percent accuracy, 8 percent precision, 29 percent recall, 11 percent F1 and 89 percent specificity.
* For Debt Consolidation loans a threshold of 6.9 percent achieves 78 percent accuracy, 9 percent precision, 51 percent recall, 15 percent F1 and 79 percent specificity.
Across all segments the area under the precision–recall curve now lies between 0.07 and 0.08, a range that is fully consistent with the 1.78 percent base default rate and therefore indicates no hidden loss of model resolution.

4 Operational soundness checks
MRO complemented the statistical tests with several operational diagnostics to verify that model outputs align with business-processing realities:
* The overall funding rate stands at 97.40 percent. Primary applications fund at 97.11 percent and secondary applications at 98.89 percent. Funding rates by loan purpose are tightly clustered: 96.53 percent for Home Improvement, 98.15 percent for Auto, 97.38 percent for Other and 96.51 percent for Debt Consolidation.
* The time-to-fund distribution is right-skewed; while isolated transactions take as long as fifty days to fund, the bulk of loans disburse within only a few days, echoing established LightStream operational patterns.
* The correlation between funding latency and funded amount is negligible at approximately 0.08, indicating that model scores do not introduce unintended bias toward either faster or slower processing of larger balances.
* The score distribution retains its expected right skew, and a side-by-side box-plot confirms that predicted probabilities are materially higher for accounts that actually defaulted, providing another qualitative affirmation of score integrity.
