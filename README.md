Thank you for the clarification. We understand the team plans to monitor parameter stability and recalibrate distributions through OGM. However, it remains important during development to assess the robustness of fitted parameters.
Evaluating confidence intervals (CIs) allows MRO to confirm that parameter uncertainty is consistent with data characteristics, that the model behaves as expected under this uncertainty, and that management is aware of the inherent sensitivity in loss forecasts. As discussed, large CIs are expected given the limited and skewed nature of operational loss data; the goal is not to eliminate this uncertainty but to quantify and understand its implications. Even when large, CIs communicate to management how much variability to expect in forecasted losses or capital.
Finally, while the current MDD metrics (p-values, AIC, Q–Q plots) address goodness-of-fit and significance, they cannot substitute for CI analysis. CI-based testing serves a distinct purpose: evaluating the stability of outputs under plausible parameter variation, which is essential for assessing model robustness.
For these reasons, MRO requested that confidence intervals be calculated and reviewed for key fitted parameters.
