MRO evaluated the adequacy of the data quality analysis performed by the model developer and carried out an independent review of the all_table dataset. The all_table dataset serves as the consolidated quarterly staging table for OGM processing and is constructed from the source systems.

MRO confirmed that the developer’s checks covered input distributions, model use monitoring, risk rating distributions, and default history. For ABL input distributions, collateral class composition, control type, and valuation methods remained stable across quarters. Accounts Receivable accounted for 38–39 percent, Inventory 32–33 percent, Government Receivables 1–2 percent, Others 21–23 percent, and Unsecured 5 percent. Control type was consistently concentrated in Monitored & Perfected Security Interest at 97 percent, with 2 percent in Perfected Security Interest and 1 percent in Others. Valuation methods were dominated by Net Orderly Liquidation Value at 78–80 percent, followed by Net Book Value at 11–12 percent, Fair Market Value at 8–10 percent, and Net Forced Liquidation Value at 1 percent.

For Non-ABL input distributions, Accounts Receivable ranged from 62 to 67 percent, Government Receivables from 9 to 12 percent, Inventory from 17 to 19 percent, Others from 3 to 15 percent, and Unsecured from 0 to 2 percent. Control types were balanced between Enhanced Monitoring (30–37 percent), Standard Monitoring (42–47 percent), and Others (20–23 percent). Valuation methods were concentrated in Net Book Value at 97–98 percent, with smaller shares in Net Orderly Liquidation Value (2 percent) and Fair Market Value (1 percent).

Model use monitoring showed a gradual decline in ABL facilities, from 256 obligations in 2024Q2 to 219 in 2025Q1. ABL dollars outstanding ranged from approximately $2.87 billion to $3.28 billion, with commitments ranging from $11.57 billion to $13.80 billion. In contrast, SF facilities grew over the same period, from 57 obligations in 2024Q2 to 82 in 2025Q1. SF dollars outstanding increased from $117 million to $183 million, and commitments from $752 million to $1.37 billion.

LGD risk rating distributions showed Grade B as the largest share across all quarters, ranging from 43 to 48 percent model versus 36 to 40 percent final. Grade C was consistently higher in the final ratings, ranging from 25 to 28 percent, compared with 8 to 9 percent in the model. Other grades (D through I) remained stable between 1 and 10 percent, with negligible higher grades.

Default history reported one default in 2024Q2 with $2.5 million exposure, one default in 2024Q3 with $32.0 million exposure, thirteen defaults in 2024Q4 with $199.0 million exposure, and three defaults in 2025Q1 with $52.2 million exposure. Realized LGD values were 0 percent in 2024Q2–2024Q4 and 20.9–21.4 percent in 2025Q1. Estimated model LGD values ranged from 7.08 to 40 percent, while estimated final LGD values ranged from 12.5 to 40 percent.

Across 2024Q2 through 2025Q1, MRO observed stable input distributions, consistent control type, and valuation method application, with no material shifts in collateral mix. ABL portfolios showed gradual contraction, while SF facilities expanded. Risk rating distributions demonstrated consistent model-to-final differences, and default tracking was comprehensive though sample sizes remained small
