MOD1497 is classified as a Tier 2 model, which under normal policy would require OGM submissions on a semi-annual basis. However, as a remediation plan (RP-15446668) to Archer finding FND-15446005, Model Development increased the frequency of Ongoing Monitoring and Governance (OGM) to quarterly to account for the heightened risk and to better inform refresh/redevelopment plans. The increased OGM frequency/cadence started from the 2024Q2 OGM and will continue until redevelopment is completed, with the new model planned to be implemented and in use starting from December 2026.

MRO reviewed the OGM reports for MOD1497 covering the period 2024Q2 through 2025Q1.

Performance monitoring results were prepared and submitted each quarter. The reports included model usage, rating distributions, performance measures, and early warning indicators. A self-assessment rating and action plan were documented in each period.

Across all four quarters reviewed, the model had consecutive breaches in the material override rate. The metric was rated “Poor” in 2024Q2, 2024Q3, 2024Q4, and 2025Q1, and the self-assessment ratings were reported as “Breach(es) – Elevated Concern” for 2024Q2 through 2024Q4 and “Not performing as intended” in 2025Q1. The breaches reflect that the observed override rate exceeded the tolerance set in the OGM plan. The action plans referred to remediation under Archer finding FND-15446005, with the OGM cadence increased to quarterly under RP-15446668. No separate MSI was created, and no additional plan was required given that redevelopment is already scheduled.

Other performance measures such as discriminatory power and level performance were not assessed due to insufficient resolved defaults, and this was clearly noted in each report. Directional shift testing showed balanced rating migrations across all quarters. Population stability indicators (PSI) were generally marked as “NA – Insufficient count in buckets,” except for Non-ABL control type, which showed “Acceptable population shift” in 2024Q3, 2024Q4, and 2025Q1.

Because the override rate remained outside tolerance, MRO requested a root cause analysis from the developer. The developer reported that approximately 60–70 percent of overrides were upgrades, most linked to the reason code “Other Collateral Strengths.” MRO carried out its own independent analysis of override activity and confirmed that the developer’s results were consistent with what was observed in the OGM data. By reviewing repeat events across quarters, MRO found that 49 percent of rating events were repeat overrides and 30 percent of obligors had repeat overrides. MRO then asked the developer to explain what was included under “Other Collateral Strengths.” The developer clarified that this reason code covered factors such as cross-collateralization, PPP guarantees, appraisal practices, and facility-specific monitoring results not fully captured by the model.

MRO assessed the developer’s analysis as responsive and consistent with MRO’s own testing, and noted that the explanations aligned with observed results. MRO did not raise a separate risk item, since the override issue is already covered by Archer finding FND-15446005, which requires redevelopment of the LGD scorecard under remediation plan RP-15446668.

The OGM reporting was timely, with escalation plans and remediation references documented in each quarter, and the increased quarterly monitoring frequency has been maintained in line with the remediation plan.
