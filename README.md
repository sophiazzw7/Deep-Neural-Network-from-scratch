Here’s your revised email, incorporating the request for **directional override patterns** while keeping the tone firm, concise, and professional:

**Subject:** Follow-Up: Material Override Analysis

Hi \[Name],

Just following up on our previous outreach regarding material override breaches. To clarify our request:

Could you please provide an updated analysis of **material overrides from 2024Q1 through 2025Q1**, including the **root causes by override reason**? We’re also interested in whether **repeat obligors or loans** have been identified across quarters and the significance of their impact. Additionally, have any **consistent directional patterns** been observed over time?

Lastly, if any **compensating controls** have been considered or implemented to mitigate the risk of continued reliance on the model prior to redevelopment, we’d appreciate that context as well.

Best,
Phoebe

Let me know if you want to tailor this further for tone (e.g., firmer, friendlier, or more detailed).
