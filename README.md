Model Risk Tier Assessment and Components

As part of the annual validation, MRO requested the latest MCA form for AH4953. The prior MCA was stored on MIMS but could not be located in SNOW, and neither the developer nor governance team were able to provide a copy. MRO therefore requested that the developer re-submit the MCA.

During this review, MRO also noted that the model documentation listed coverage as approximately $1B in PAG deals annually prior to 2019, while there have been no PAG deals since. Follow-up with the line of business confirmed current expectations of approximately $50M in annual PAG volumes. MRO highlighted the discrepancy and requested that the developer align the MCA and MDD to reflect the updated coverage.

The developer subsequently re-submitted the MCA and updated the MDD to ensure consistency across documents. The revised MDD now reflects the updated coverage, aligns the model use description to include pricing/valuation consistently, and clarifies that the data availability rating of “Low” was driven by limited PAG deal activity in recent years.

Based on this review, MRO concludes that the model risk tier assessment and supporting components are appropriately documented in the updated MCA and MDD, and that inconsistencies identified during the review have been addressed by the developer.
