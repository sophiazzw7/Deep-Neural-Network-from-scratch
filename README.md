Following up on my earlier outreach to the model user on June 26 — she shared a few potential adjustments, including tightening the auto-decline rule for the segment where we’ve seen performance issues.

Would you be able to work with her to formalize these compensating controls and help document them in the MDD? This would help ensure we have a clear interim plan in place while the model rebuild is in progress.
