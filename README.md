There are no model overlays or overrides applicable to the Sheffield PAG model. Given insufficient PAG deal volume since 2019, recent OGM periods have not generated testing evidence. Instead, performance has been assessed based on available results and rated Performing as Intended.

MRO notes that the lack of new PAG deals limits the ability to directly evaluate performance trends. However, continued monitoring through OGM reporting remains in place, and no additional issues were identified beyond existing limitations already noted in the MDD.

Periodic OGM results are incorporated into the MDD Model Performance section and used as complementary information in assessing overall model performance. Key monitoring expectations include:

Confirming that performance monitoring results are reported, reviewed, and documented as frequently as appropriate.

Ensuring all significant performance deviations are investigated and assessed properly in a timely manner.

Evaluating threshold breaches, as applicable, and assessing follow-up actions and investigation results.

Confirming that timely model performance monitoring results are reported to governing committees and stakeholders.

Since there have been no or limited PAG deals since 2019, OGM testing could not be performed. As a result, the 2022Q2, 2022Q4, 2024Q2, and 2024Q4 OGM assessments rated the model as Performing as Intended.
