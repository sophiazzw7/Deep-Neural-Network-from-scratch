The Sheffield PAG model is used for pricing and valuation of Sheffield PAG loans.

The model forecasts expected payment default risk and prepayment risk for potential Sheffield PAG pools under forecasted economic conditions.

The model applies a survival/hazard framework to estimate monthly default rates and paydown rates, which are then used in loss-adjusted pricing.

The model incorporates borrower and loan attributes such as Vantage Score 4.0 and TransUnion Bankruptcy Score to predict portfolio risk.

The model use is limited to valuation, and there are no other approved or validated uses.

Since 2019, there have been limited to no Sheffield PAG deals originated. As a result, OGM reports for 2022Q2, 2022Q4, 2023Q4, and 2024Q4 contained no PAG data and did not produce testing results.

During this annual review, MRO asked the model developer to confirm expected volumes with the Line of Business. The LOB reported that annual Sheffield PAG production is expected to be approximately $50 million.
