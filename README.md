MRO’s independent assessment concluded that the 2024Q2 and 2024Q4 production datasets are structurally sound and appropriate for model monitoring. Input fields, target labels, and overall data integrity met expectations, with no material data issues identified. However, performance testing revealed breaches in AUC and KS thresholds for select loan-purpose segments. While a full model rebuild is in progress, compensating controls—such as tightened auto-decline rules and targeted monitoring—have been implemented to mitigate risk in the interim.
