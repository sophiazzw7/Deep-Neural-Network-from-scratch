MRO reviewed the model documentation to assess whether the information provided was sufficient to support the independent validation effort. The documentation provided includes a description of the business objectives of the model, the major assumptions, limitations, and intended use. It also outlines the methodology for calculating Exposure at Default, Recoverable Collateral Value, and Loss Given Default.

The business objective of the ABL and Borrowing Base LGD scorecard is to provide Loss Given Default estimates for secured lending exposures within the ABL portfolio. The intended use is for credit risk measurement and capital allocation, consistent with regulatory requirements and internal risk management practices. The major assumptions include the application of Loan Equivalency Factors by product type, the use of recovery parameters differentiated by collateral class and valuation method, and the application of control adjustors to reflect varying levels of collateral control. A key limitation disclosed in the documentation is that the model is based on expert-opinion calibration rather than statistical estimation, due to the lack of default history in the ABL portfolio since 2007.

The description of methodology in the documentation is extensive and covers EAD, RCV, and LGD calculations. EAD is determined separately for term loans and revolvers, with specific Loan Equivalency Factors applied for each product type. RCV is derived from collateral values using recovery parameters by collateral class and valuation method, with multiplicative control adjustors applied to account for the strength of the security interest. LGD is then calculated from secured and unsecured recoveries relative to total EAD, with adjustments for guarantees and reserves. Floors and caps are applied where appropriate to align with expert judgment.

MRO noted gaps when comparing the documentation to results from data testing of the OGM datasets. While the methodology section of the documentation describes the framework for EAD, RCV, and LGD calculations, it does not provide details on the construction of monitoring datasets, the treatment of exclusions, or the derivation of key override fields. MRO’s independent testing of the OGM datasets confirmed that overrides were consistently identified and that the developer’s code logic excluded records as documented. However, MRO observed through testing that the concentration of overrides in the “Other Collateral Strengths” category and the persistence of repeat overrides indicate that the methodology does not capture certain collateral-specific factors at origination, leading to reliance on overrides in practice.

The logic and input data tested by MRO included the identification of overrides, calculation of override severity, and repeat override persistence across quarters. MRO confirmed that override identification was based on differences between model ratings and final ratings, with the severity measure derived from the notching difference. MRO also verified that the repeat override logic tracked obligors across quarters and identified repeat instances accurately. Testing results confirmed the presence of consecutive breaches and high upgrade concentrations, consistent with the developer’s own analysis.

In conclusion, the documentation provides a clear description of the model’s methodology, assumptions, and limitations, but it does not address the specific implementation details of OGM dataset construction or monitoring logic. MRO’s testing showed that while the methodology is applied consistently in monitoring, gaps remain in the model’s ability to capture collateral-specific information at origination, resulting in sustained reliance on overrides. These limitations are already the subject of remediation under Archer finding FND-15446005.
Because this active Archer finding already addresses the sustained override issue, MRO has aligned its observations to FND-15446005 rather than opening a new risk item. MRO will continue to monitor override persistence and concentrations in future OGM results and will track progress against the remediation commitments under the Archer finding.
