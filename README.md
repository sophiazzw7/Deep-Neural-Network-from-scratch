Subject: Follow-up Items on Frequency/Severity Fit and OGM Plan

Hi Cheng and Rashmi,

Hope you’re both doing well. As part of MRO’s independent review, we’ve summarized a few follow-up questions regarding the frequency/severity model fit and the OGM plan. The detailed list is attached.

At a high level:
• For the frequency model, our AD test and simulation-based quantile check showed some tail differences, and we’d appreciate your perspective.
• For the severity mixture models, our simulation-based quantile comparison showed some deviations at both the mid-tail and upper-tail, and we’d like to confirm whether this behavior is expected.
• For the OGM plan, we had several clarifications and suggestions related to SME documentation, metric definitions, threshold calibration, and escalation steps.

Whenever you have time, could you please take a look and let us know your thoughts?

Thank you both for your support.

Best regards,
Phoebe
