Scenario analysis during development assessed model response to Baseline (BL) and Adverse (S3) macroeconomic conditions using Moodyâ€™s forecasts. With the May 2018 static pool, results showed expected stress behavior:

Baseline (24-month): $613K defaults, $270K NCO, $9.46M paydown.

Adverse S3 (24-month): $994K defaults, $583K NCO, $9.08M paydown.

Outcomes confirmed defaults and losses increase while paydowns decline under adverse conditions. No further scenario testing is required since model parameters remain fixed; continued monitoring will occur through OGM.
