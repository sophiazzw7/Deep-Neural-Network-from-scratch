### Summary of Data Quality Assessment — 2024Q2 and 2024Q4

MRO conducted independent data quality reviews of the 2024Q2 and 2024Q4 production files for the LightStream PD model. Each file contained over 200,000 application records and was evaluated across dozens of fields for completeness, logical consistency, outliers, and calibration integrity.

Across both quarters, MRO observed no material data quality concerns. Variable ranges remained within expected business and statistical bounds; the model score consistently respected the \[0, 1] probability range, and all FICO values fell within the 300–850 band. No duplicate records were found in either dataset once the JSON-style `DATA` field was excluded. Additionally, missing values were generally limited to fields logically blank for most accounts (e.g., charge-off fields in non-defaulted loans), and no violations were found in the temporal sequencing of key application milestones.

Both datasets showed consistent levels of missingness in delinquency history fields, with a stable subset of accounts (183 in Q2, 437 in Q4) showing no past-due information and a correspondingly low observed default rate. In Q4, MRO also identified that 1,043 defaulted loans (approximately 18% of defaults) lacked CHARGEOFFAMOUNT values, a pattern consistent with lag between servicing systems and bureau reporting.

Outlier analysis revealed small pockets of extreme values in funded amounts and latency, but all such records were explainable and remained within plausible operational ranges. Calibration by PLRS decile remained monotonic in both quarters, confirming directional consistency of the PD scores.

While the overall data structure and content remain appropriate for model performance monitoring, MRO notes that the consistency of missingness patterns and data anomalies across quarters underscores the importance of robust first-line data controls. The model development team should establish formalized monitoring and reconciliation checks to validate the integrity of production scoring files prior to use. These controls should ensure timely and complete ingestion of all required fields, particularly for delinquency history and charge-off attributes, to safeguard downstream model performance and reporting accuracy.
