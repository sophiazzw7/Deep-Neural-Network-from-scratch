**Subject:** Proposal to Adjust KS Thresholds Using Pooled 3σ Control Limits

Hi \<Name>,

I've carefully reviewed the current KS threshold methodology and propose a minor adjustment that retains the bootstrap framework while improving threshold stability and interpretability.

### Current Approach Overview

The existing method for setting thresholds involves:

1. Drawing 1,000 bootstrap samples per quarter (Q1–Q4 plus "All Quarters").
2. Computing mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) for each quarter.
3. Defining thresholds: Red = μ − 4σ; Green = μ − 3σ.
4. Selecting the **minimum** of the five quarterly thresholds.

This approach performs well for AUC since its variance is relatively low (\~0.02). However, it becomes problematic for KS, as KS metrics show substantially higher volatility (σ ranges \~0.035 to 0.09). Specifically, Q2 had notably fewer default events, causing a large spike in standard deviation and significantly lowering the final thresholds.

For instance:

| Segment            | Q4 KS | Current Red Threshold | Performance Decline Needed for Red Flag |
| ------------------ | ----- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Auto               | 0.380 | 0.1616 (set by Q2)    | Approximately 57% decline               |
| Debt Consolidation | 0.277 | 0.1310 (set by Q2)    | Approximately 59% decline               |
| Home Improvement   | 0.282 | 0.2475                | Approximately 44% decline               |
| Others             | 0.270 | 0.1540 (set by Q2)    | Approximately 60% decline               |

In particular, the Auto, Debt Consolidation, and Others segments would need to lose over half of their discriminatory power before triggering a red alert, significantly diminishing the practical effectiveness of KS monitoring.
Quarter 2 specifically had fewer defaults, causing unusually large standard deviations:

* **Auto segment:** Q2 KS σ = 0.0773 (more than double the pooled σ of 0.0350).
* **Debt Consolidation segment:** Q2 KS σ = 0.0923 (more than double the pooled σ of 0.0428).

I suggest a minor yet impactful refinement:


* Pool all funded loans across quarters first ("All Quarters") to reduce sensitivity to any single volatile quarter.
* Eliminate the "minimum-of-five" quarterly threshold selection, since pooling sufficiently addresses quarterly volatility.

Applying the pooled approach using the values from Table 18-1 (All Quarters):
n.

| Segment            | μ      | σ      |Red(μ−4σ) | Yellow (μ − 3σ) | 
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | --------------- | 
| Auto               | 0.3970 | 0.0350 | 0.2570   | 0.2920          | 
| Debt Consolidation | 0.3178 | 0.0155 | 0.2558   | 0.2713          | 
| Home Improvement   | 0.4412 | 0.0273 | 0.3320   | 0.3593          |
| Others             | 0.3841 | 0.0288 | 0.2689   | 0.2977          |
