2 Discrimination capability
To measure how effectively the model separates defaulting from non-defaulting exposures, MRO generated receiver-operating-characteristic curves, cumulative-accuracy-profile curves, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics and Gini coefficients for each of the business-critical loan-purpose segments. The key results are reproduced below in sentence form for clarity:
* For Home Improvement loans the area under the ROC curve (AUC) equals 0.68, the KS statistic equals 0.27 and the Gini coefficient equals 0.36.
* For Auto loans the corresponding values are an AUC of 0.78, a KS of 0.45 and a Gini of 0.57.
* The Other-purpose segment records an AUC of 0.74, a KS of 0.43 and a Gini of 0.47.
* The Debt Consolidation segment shows an AUC of 0.70, a KS of 0.36 and a Gini of 0.41.
In every segment the ROC and CAP curves generated by MRO lie well above the reference diagonal, confirming that the model continues to provide useful rank ordering of credit risk. None of the discrimination statistics fall below the firm’s internal alert thresholds, and no evidence of material drift is observed within the review period.

3 Classification behaviour
The production score-to-action mapping in force during the quarter assigns virtually every application to the “non-default” class. This policy yields overall accuracy close to 98 percent, but both precision and recall measure at zero because no accounts are flagged as likely defaults.
To explore whether a less-extreme cut-off can deliver a more balanced trade-off, MRO performed a grid search for the probability threshold that maximises the F1 score in each segment. The optimal thresholds and the associated confusion-matrix metrics are summarised below in narrative form:
* When a probability cut-off of 3.9 percent is applied to Home Improvement loans, accuracy becomes 78 percent, precision 7 percent, recall 46 percent, F1 13 percent and specificity 79 percent.
* A cut-off of 4.4 percent for Auto loans yields 88 percent accuracy; precision and recall are 7 percent and 39 percent respectively, producing an F1 score of 12 percent and specificity of 90 percent.
* For the Other-purpose segment a threshold of 6.8 percent results in 88 percent accuracy, 8 percent precision, 29 percent recall, 11 percent F1 and 89 percent specificity.
* For Debt Consolidation loans a threshold of 6.9 percent achieves 78 percent accuracy, 9 percent precision, 51 percent recall, 15 percent F1 and 79 percent specificity.
Across all segments the area under the precision–recall curve now lies between 0.07 and 0.08, a range that is fully consistent with the 1.78 percent base default rate and therefore indicates no hidden loss of model resolution.

4 Operational soundness checks
MRO complemented the statistical tests with several operational diagnostics to verify that model outputs align with business-processing realities:
* The overall funding rate stands at 97.40 percent. Primary applications fund at 97.11 percent and secondary applications at 98.89 percent. Funding rates by loan purpose are tightly clustered: 96.53 percent for Home Improvement, 98.15 percent for Auto, 97.38 percent for Other and 96.51 percent for Debt Consolidation.
* The time-to-fund distribution is right-skewed; while isolated transactions take as long as fifty days to fund, the bulk of loans disburse within only a few days, echoing established LightStream operational patterns.
* The correlation between funding latency and funded amount is negligible at approximately 0.08, indicating that model scores do not introduce unintended bias toward either faster or slower processing of larger balances.
* The score distribution retains its expected right skew, and a side-by-side box-plot confirms that predicted probabilities are materially higher for accounts that actually defaulted, providing another qualitative affirmation of score integrity.

## 2  Discrimination capability

To quantify the model’s ability to distinguish defaulting from non-defaulting exposures, MRO generated the customary suite of receiver-operating-characteristic and cumulative-accuracy-profile curves, together with Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics and Gini coefficients, for each business-critical loan-purpose segment.  The analysis shows that for Home Improvement loans the area under the ROC curve (AUC) equals **0.68**, the KS statistic equals **0.27** and the Gini coefficient equals **0.36**.  Auto loans continue to perform best, posting an AUC of **0.78**, a KS of **0.45** and a Gini of **0.57**.  The Other-purpose segment records an AUC of **0.74**, a KS of **0.43** and a Gini of **0.47**, while the Debt-Consolidation segment registers an AUC of **0.70**, a KS of **0.36** and a Gini of **0.41**.  In every segment the empirical ROC and CAP curves lie well above the reference diagonal, confirming that the model still provides robust rank-ordering of credit risk.  None of the discrimination statistics approaches the firm’s internal alert thresholds and no material drift is observed over the review period.

## 3  Classification behaviour

During the quarter the model was operated with a probability cut-off so high that every application was effectively labelled “non-default.”  Because the overwhelming majority of borrowers ultimately repay, this approve-all setting yielded an apparent accuracy of roughly **ninety-eight per cent**; however, it also produced mathematical precision and recall of **zero**, as no loans were ever flagged as risky.

To establish what the model could deliver under a more balanced decision rule, MRO performed a grid search for the probability threshold that maximises the F1 score—defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall—within each loan-purpose segment.  For every candidate threshold a confusion matrix was constructed and the associated metrics calculated.  Accuracy was taken as the proportion of correct classifications, precision as the share of predicted defaults that were truly defaulting, recall as the proportion of actual defaults that were correctly identified, F1 as the joint balance of precision and recall, and specificity as the proportion of performing loans that were correctly left unflagged.  Log-loss was also inspected to ensure that probability estimates did not become unstable at the selected cut-offs.

The optimisation shows that a threshold of **3.9 per cent** for Home Improvement loans yields approximately seventy-eight per cent accuracy, seven-and-one-half per cent precision and forty-six per cent recall, resulting in an F1 score of about thirteen per cent.  For Auto loans a cut-off of **4.4 per cent** achieves nearly eighty-eight per cent accuracy, with precision close to seven-and-one-half per cent and recall just under thirty-nine per cent, giving an F1 score of roughly twelve per cent.  The Other-purpose segment attains eighty-eight per cent accuracy, eight per cent precision and twenty-nine per cent recall at a threshold of **6.8 per cent**, producing an F1 score of eleven per cent.  Finally, a threshold of **6.9 per cent** for Debt-Consolidation loans delivers seventy-eight per cent accuracy, nine per cent precision and fifty-one per cent recall, with an F1 score of fifteen per cent.  In all segments the area under the precision-recall curve falls between **0.07** and **0.08**, a range fully consistent with the 1.78 per cent base default rate and therefore indicative of undiminished model resolution once the extreme class imbalance is taken into account.

## 4  Operational soundness checks

Statistical validation was complemented by a series of operational diagnostics designed to confirm that the model’s outputs remain aligned with business-processing realities.  The overall funding rate during the quarter stands at **97.40 per cent**.  Primary applications fund at **97.11 per cent** and secondary applications at **98.89 per cent**.  Funding rates by purpose show little dispersion, registering **96.53 per cent** for Home Improvement, **98.15 per cent** for Auto, **97.38 per cent** for Other and **96.51 per cent** for Debt Consolidation.  The time-to-fund distribution retains the expected right skew: although a handful of transactions required up to fifty days to disburse, the great majority funded within a few days, mirroring established LightStream practice.  The correlation between funding latency and funded amount is negligible at **0.08**, indicating that score-driven workflow does not favour either faster or slower processing of larger balances.  Finally, the score distribution itself remains right-skewed, and side-by-side box plots confirm that predicted probabilities are materially higher for loans that eventually defaulted, providing an additional qualitative affirmation of score integrity.

Taken together, the discrimination statistics, threshold-optimised classification metrics and operational diagnostics offer no evidence of performance deterioration or operational friction.  The model continues to satisfy the firm’s quantitative standards and remains fit for purpose throughout the review period.
