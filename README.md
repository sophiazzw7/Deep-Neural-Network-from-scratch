MRO’s validation identified repeated breaches of the override threshold, driven primarily by persistent use of the “Other Collateral Strengths” reason code within the ABL segment. Through independent analysis, MRO confirmed that overrides are concentrated in a limited set of facility-level factors such as cross-collateralization, borrowing base utilization, and dealer finance receivables. MRO also confirmed that approximately 5% of ABL exposures in the past four OGM periods were unsecured, which conceptually deviates from the collateralized nature of ABL lending. These issues reflect structural design limitations rather than data or monitoring gaps.

Compensating controls, including the increase of OGM frequency, mitigate near-term risk by enhancing transparency; however, they do not resolve the underlying design weaknesses. MRO did not raise a new risk item given that an Archer finding is already in place and the model is undergoing redevelopment. Instead, MRO recommended that the redesign explicitly incorporate treatment of unsecured loans and systematically capture recurring collateral drivers such as cross-collateralization, borrowing base practices, and dealer finance receivables.
