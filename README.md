Here’s a structured draft for your **Model Performance Review** section based on the eight backtesting/performance screenshots you shared:

### Model Performance Review


**Backtesting of LGD forecasts**
Backtesting is designed to compare realized outcomes against the model’s LGD forecasts. However, across the 2024Q2–2025Q1 OGM review periods, the number of resolved defaults in the applicable windows was too small to conduct meaningful tests. The backtesting windows showed only 8–9 resolved defaults in ABL and none in Non-ABL, well below the minimum threshold of 30 defaults required under the OGM plan. Consequently, all test results defaulted to “NA – Insufficient resolved default counts.” While this limits the ability to quantitatively validate realized versus forecast LGD, the accumulation of defaults in future cycles may allow more substantive testing. The current outcome is consistent with expectations given the low default environment.
