Hi [Boss's Name],

Hope you're doing well. Cheng followed up today asking for an estimated timeline for the Credit Karma portion of MOD13512 validation, as LightStream is waiting to implement.

Since I’m currently at full capacity, I wanted to check with you on what would be the best path forward. You had previously mentioned the possibility of an exception to implement without validation — just wanted to confirm whether that’s still an option being considered, or if we should revisit resourcing for this piece.

Happy to align with whatever makes most sense.

Best,
Phoebe
