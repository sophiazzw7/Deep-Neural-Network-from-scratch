The model developer listed the following key limitations in Section XXX of the Model Development Document (MDD). These items are also addressed in the OGM plan, primarily through the material override metric, rating distribution checks, and model coverage reviews.

Lack of data for quantitative/statistical modeling – Reliance on SME opinion due to insufficient defaults; monitored through the material override metric.

Lack of data for statistical performance measures – Benchmarking and validation constrained by data; monitored through the material override metric.

Dependence on overrides and potential bias – Final rating may reflect user adjustment rather than model factors; monitored through the material override metric.

Expansion to Non-ABL Borrowing Base – Scorecard built for ABL may not fully capture Non-ABL risks; monitored through the material override metric for ABL and Non-ABL.

Use of unsecured MOD1366 as benchmark – May limit LGD range for Non-ABL facilities; monitored through OGM reporting and material override metric.

Limited Non-ABL sample (10%) – Parameters may not represent all scenarios; mitigation through sample construction, no specific OGM metric.

Collateral coverage scope – Non-ABL analysis restricted to A/R and inventory valued by NBV; monitored through model coverage by ABL and Non-ABL.
