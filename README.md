Hi [Visa Team's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to kindly follow up on the LCA form I sent two weeks ago for my H-1B renewal. Please let me know if there’s anything else you need from me or if I can help in any way to support the process.

Thank you so much for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Phoebe

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the instructions. I had actually followed the same steps earlier and was able to access the workbench, but I couldn’t locate the specific data, which is why I reached out.

Appreciate your help—please let me know if there’s another place I should check.

Best,
Phoebe
