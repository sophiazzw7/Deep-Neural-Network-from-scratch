Subject: Follow-up on LGD Methodology and Data Questions

Hi Kevin,

It was great speaking with you last Thursday. I’m following up to share my responses to the LGD methodology, EAD definition, SF portfolio clarification, and related data questions. Please see the attached write-up and supporting Excel for details.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further. I’ll be out Thursday and Friday, but happy to follow up after.

Best regards,
Phoebe
