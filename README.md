**Subject:** Quick Follow-Up: MCA Re-submission and PAG Coverage

Hi John,

Hope you're doing well. Just following up on the MCA re-submission and the PAG coverage question. Thanks again for your earlier response — wanted to check if there’s been any update on either the form being re-submitted or the expected PAG volumes going forward.

As the validation is scheduled to wrap up around the **last week of September**, this would likely be noted as a **sub-issue** if it remains unresolved.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,
Sophia
