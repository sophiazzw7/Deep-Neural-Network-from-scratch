# Deep-Neural-Network-from-scratch

This is a project where I built a Deep Neural Network to perform Photo classification. 
I build the model from scratch, where I calculated the Forward and Backward Propagation, calculated the loss function and updated parameters.

ically significant difference between the current model and the hyperopt model, further substantiated the selection of the current model. This investigation offers valuable insights into model comparison techniques and the limitations of specific statistical tests, contributing to a well-informed decision-making process.
