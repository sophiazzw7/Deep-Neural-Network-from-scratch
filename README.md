LGD Risk Rating Distribution

MRO reviewed the LGD risk rating distributions for 2024Q2 through 2025Q1 as part of the OGM testing. The analysis compared the model-assigned grades to the final ratings after overrides.

In 2024Q2, the distribution was based on 315 records. Model grades were concentrated in the B through K range. The model assigned 48 percent to Grade B, compared with 40 percent in the final. The model assigned 9 percent to Grade C, while the final rating increased to 28 percent. Grades D and E showed limited change, with the model at 7 percent and 3 percent and the final at 8 percent and 1 percent respectively. The model assigned 5 percent to Grade F, 3 percent to Grade G, 4 percent to Grade H, 10 percent to Grade I, and 11 percent to Grade K, while the final distribution was 4 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 10 percent, and 2 percent respectively. These results indicated a notable shift from the model distribution to the final distribution, particularly with more exposures concentrated in Grade C after overrides.

In 2024Q3, the distribution was based on 319 records. The model assigned 47 percent to Grade B, which was reduced to 39 percent in the final ratings. The model assigned 9 percent to Grade C, while the final increased substantially to 26 percent. Grade D was stable at 7 percent model and 8 percent final. Grade E showed minimal change at 3 percent model and 2 percent final. Grades F through I were generally consistent between model and final, with 7 percent versus 7 percent for Grade F, 3 percent versus 2 percent for Grade G, 9 percent versus 9 percent for Grade H, and 7 percent versus 6 percent for Grade I. The largest change was again the increase in Grade C after overrides.

In 2024Q4, the distribution was based on 309 records. The model assigned 46 percent to Grade B compared with 39 percent in the final. The model assigned 8 percent to Grade C, while the final was higher at 25 percent. Grade D remained at 8 percent in both model and final. Grade E was slightly lower at 3 percent model compared with 2 percent final. Grades F through I showed minor shifts, with 9 percent versus 9 percent for Grade F, 3 percent versus 2 percent for Grade G, 10 percent versus 9 percent for Grade H, and 4 percent versus 4 percent for Grade I. The overall pattern of Grade B moving into Grade C after overrides persisted.

In 2025Q1, the distribution was based on 302 records. The model assigned 43 percent to Grade B compared with 36 percent in the final. The model assigned 9 percent to Grade C, while the final increased to 26 percent. Grade D remained consistent at 8 percent for both model and final. Grade E showed a reduction from 4 percent in the model to 2 percent in the final. Grades F through I were aligned between model and final, with 8 percent versus 8 percent for Grade F, 3 percent versus 3 percent for Grade G, 10 percent versus 9 percent for Grade H, and 6 percent versus 6 percent for Grade I. Grade K was 9 percent model compared with only 1 percent final.

Across all four quarters, MRO observed that model ratings consistently placed a large share of exposures in Grade B, while final ratings shifted many of these exposures into Grade C. This persistent pattern contributed to the high frequency of override activity and confirmed that the override impact was concentrated in upward adjustments.
