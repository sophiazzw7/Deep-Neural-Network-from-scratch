Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the six key limitations, clearly abbreviated while preserving the meaning:

### **Key Model Assumptions, Risks & Limitations (ARL)**

1. **External Data Control**: Use of third-party data limits control over data quality.
2. **Missing Financial Data**: High missing rates in MRA Financial Statement data, especially PFA for Individual Guarantors pre-2010.
3. **Low Default Rates**: Limited defaults in ITBE Batch portfolio constrain WOE binning, training/testing splits, and NFP/RO regression calibration.
4. **TBE Scope Misalignment**: Development data uses obligor-level exposure, while production applies Relationship-level TBE (available only post-2016).
5. **Reject Bias**: PDA model relies on accepted obligors only, as reject inference isn't applicable for new clients, possibly introducing bias.
6. **No Macro Factors**: Wholesale Batch models exclude macroeconomic variables from regression.
