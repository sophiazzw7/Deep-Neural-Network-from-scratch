Hi Kevin,

Following up on our conversation last Thursday, I wanted to share my responses to the LGD methodology, EAD definition, SF portfolio clarification, and related data analysis questions. Please see the attached write-up for a detailed point-by-point response, along with the supporting Excel files.

Let me know if you’d like to discuss further—I’ll be out Thursday and Friday but happy to connect after.

Best regards,
Phoebe
