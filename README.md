Hi Mike,

Thanks for the clarification — that makes sense, and we can wait to hear back from the OGM team for confirmation on those points.

I had a quick follow-up: since the model has OGM reporting starting in 2022Q4, which should correspond to the 2021 vintage, I didn’t see that vintage represented in the data. From your note that data collection started in late 2022, this seems inconsistent — could you help confirm?

Also, I wanted to revisit questions 4 and 5 from my earlier email regarding how duplicates with differing scores are handled and whether the 202412 OGM performance review should be limited to vintage year = 2023.

Thank you again for your help!

Best regards,
Phoebe
