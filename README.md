(Actual−Predicted)/Actual, with cumulative amounts assessed at multiple forecast horizons (3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). To minimize mischaracterization of performance, the framework applies overlapping static pools and calculates the average error across runs. Mean Bias Error (MBE) is the primary metric, as it reflects systematic under- or over-forecasting, while Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) provide supporting context. Breaches over consecutive periods trigger diagnostic reviews, including macroeconomic time series analysis and component-level evaluation.
