Sensitivity Analysis

During model development, extensive sensitivity testing was conducted to evaluate how the Sheffield PAG model responds to both macro-economic drivers and borrower attributes. Since no methodological updates or coefficient recalibrations have occurred since development, there is no need to re-perform sensitivity analysis. The model parameters remain fixed, and sensitivity to Moody’s macro-economic forecasts continues to be adequately captured through the original design.

Macro-Economic Sensitivity

The development team performed sensitivity tests by shifting macro-economic drivers (e.g., mean unemployment rate, year-over-year unemployment difference) by ±1 to ±3 standard deviations. Results demonstrated that:

Default models exhibited meaningful responsiveness to unemployment rate shocks, with probability of default (PD) changes ranging from moderate increases (≈10–20%) under small shocks to large swings (≈40–70%) under ±3 standard deviation shifts.

Paydown models were generally less sensitive to macro-economic variation, indicating relative stability of repayment behavior across economic conditions.

Outdoor Power Equipment (OPE) segment showed sensitivity patterns similar to Power Sports (PS), particularly around unemployment rate volatility.

These results confirm that macro-economic channels in the model capture plausible stress impacts, without generating unstable or counterintuitive patterns.

Borrower Attribute Sensitivity

Borrower attribute sensitivity was also tested by shifting values across key bins and comparing PD changes to the reference mean. The following drivers exhibited the strongest impact:

Origination FICO: Lower credit score bands (e.g., <660) generated very large PD increases (>200%) relative to mean values, while higher FICO bands showed significant risk differentiation.

Origination LTV: Higher LTV ratios (≥100%) produced elevated PD levels (≈200–300% above mean), consistent with expectations of riskier collateral positions.

Term Length: Longer terms (≥120 months) were associated with materially higher PDs, while shorter terms showed relatively smaller increases.

Vantage Score and Bankruptcy Score: Additional borrower credit attributes reinforced these patterns, with risk levels escalating in lower score buckets.

These results demonstrated that the model effectively differentiates borrower risk across relevant dimensions, with sensitivity concentrated in credit quality, collateral leverage, and contract maturity.

Conclusion

The sensitivity testing conducted during development provided comprehensive evidence that the Sheffield PAG model responds appropriately to both macro-economic conditions and borrower attributes. No re-testing is required for the current review period, as model coefficients and structure have not changed. The model’s design continues to reflect stable and reasonable responsiveness to Moody’s economic scenarios and borrower-level risk drivers.
