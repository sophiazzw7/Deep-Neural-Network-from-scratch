MOD1497 is classified as a Tier 2 model, which under normal policy would require Ongoing Monitoring and Governance (OGM) submissions on a semi-annual basis. However, because of repeated breaches in the material override rate, Archer finding FND-15446005 was issued. As part of the related remediation plan (RP-15446668), the reporting frequency was increased from semi-annual to quarterly, starting with the 2024Q2 cycle. The objective of this compensating control was to strengthen monitoring until the planned redevelopment of the LGD scorecard in December 2026.

The developer followed this plan and submitted quarterly OGM reports, which included self-assessment ratings, action plans, and escalation references. This was consistent with the requirements set out in RP-15446668.

MRO reviewed the results of these quarterly reports and also requested a root cause analysis from the developer regarding the override breaches. The analysis showed that 60–70 percent of overrides were upgrades, most under the reason code “Other Collateral Strengths.” Examples provided included cross-collateralization, PPP guarantees, appraisal practices, and facility-specific monitoring results. MRO’s own analysis confirmed that override activity was consistent with the developer’s findings, with nearly half of override rating events being repeat overrides and 30 percent of obligors affected.

Because the root cause analysis indicated that the override problem came from the model design itself—mainly the scorecard’s limited ability to capture collateral-related factors—simply increasing the monitoring frequency did not improve model performance. Still, since Archer finding FND-15446005 already requires redevelopment of the model, MRO did not raise a separate risk item.

9.10 Existing Compensating Measure and Its Effectiveness

As part of remediation plan RP-15446668 under Archer finding FND-15446005, the developer increased the Ongoing Monitoring and Governance (OGM) submission frequency for MOD1497 from semi-annual to quarterly, beginning with the 2024Q2 cycle. The purpose of this compensating control was to provide closer monitoring and ensure issues were tracked until redevelopment of the LGD scorecard, which is scheduled for December 2026.

The developer followed this plan by submitting quarterly OGM reports. Each report included self-assessment ratings, action plans, and escalation references. This was consistent with the requirements of RP-15446668.

During this review, MRO identified the need for a root cause analysis of the override breaches and specifically requested it from the developer. While this step was not required under RP-15446668, the developer provided the requested analysis. Both the developer’s analysis and MRO’s independent testing confirmed that the high override rate was mainly due to gaps in the model design. The LGD scorecard does not fully capture collateral-related factors such as cross-collateralization, PPP guarantees, appraisal practices, and facility-specific monitoring. As a result, overrides were often used to adjust for these factors, with about 60–70 percent of overrides classified as upgrades under the reason code “Other Collateral Strengths.” MRO also found that nearly half of override rating events were repeat overrides, and 30 percent of obligors experienced multiple overrides across quarters.

Because the problem comes from how the model is designed, increasing the monitoring frequency does not improve model performance. The compensating control was useful for tracking the issue, but it did not address the cause of the breaches.

9.11 Proposed Compensating Measure

MRO does not propose any new compensating measures. The override breaches are already covered under Archer finding FND-15446005, which requires redevelopment of the LGD scorecard. A new model is planned to be in place by December 2026.

Since the issue is already tracked, and the developer provided the requested root cause analysis during this review, MRO determined that no additional compensating measure or risk item is needed.
