Hi Amit,

I wanted to follow up on the questions we shared last week regarding MOD1497. No need to worry about Q1 — Jiao was able to help share the OGM artifacts.

When you have a moment, we’d appreciate your input on Q2 (compensating measures) and Q3 (investigation into material override breaches). Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything needs clarification.

Best regards,
Sophia
