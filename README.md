Independent MRO testing identified that model performance in the Home Improvement segment breached the firm’s outer threshold for AUC in 2024 Q2, and subsequently breached the inner (yellow) threshold for AUC in 2024 Q4. In the same Q4 period, KS was newly introduced as a formal monitoring metric within OGM. MRO reviewed the reported KS statistics against applicable thresholds and confirmed that the Others segment breached the inner threshold for this metric.

In response to the outer-threshold AUC breach for Home Improvement, MRO verified that the appropriate escalation plan—model recalibration or rebuild—has been triggered. Discussions with the model development team confirmed that the escalation protocol is being followed, and that the model rebuild is already in progress. Due to the third-party nature of the vendor model, the developers have provided a proposed rebuild timeline table outlining the expected delivery schedule.

During the interim period, the model user has implemented a compensating control in the Home Improvement segment to mitigate potential risk. Specifically, the auto-decline threshold has been raised from 630 to 660, thereby tightening approval constraints for applicants in this high-risk category.

MRO will continue to monitor the application of these controls and track progress against the proposed rebuild plan to ensure compliance with internal model risk governance.
