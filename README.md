As part of our validation review, we would like to clarify one point. In reviewing the attached table, we noted that the model is assigning LGD ratings in the Gâ€“K range. For an ABL portfolio, exposures should generally not appear in this range, since ABL lending requires collateral. If these exposures are supported by third-party guarantees, could you please confirm how guarantees are incorporated into the LGD assignment? Our concern is that the guarantee effect may not be fully reflected in these ratings.
