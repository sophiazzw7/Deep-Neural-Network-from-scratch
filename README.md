4.2 data quality testing

4.2.1 data quality testing by MD

The developer’s OGM reports for 2024Q2 through 2025Q1 included structured data quality checks across input distributions, model use monitoring, risk rating distributions, and default history.
For the ABL input distribution, collateral class composition remained stable. Accounts Receivable represented approximately 38–39 percent of exposures across all quarters, while Inventory accounted for 31–33 percent. Other collateral categories, including “Others” and “Unsecured,” made up the remaining 27 percent combined, with minimal variation over time. Control type within ABL facilities was highly concentrated, with Monitored and Perfected Security Interest consistently at 97 percent of records, while other categories remained negligible. Valuation method distributions were also stable across all quarters, with Net Orderly Liquidation Value consistently at 79 percent, Net Forced Liquidation Value around 9 percent, Fair Market Value near 10 percent, and Net Book Value at 2 percent.

For the Non-ABL input distribution, Accounts Receivable was the largest category, ranging from 62 to 67 percent across quarters. Accounts Receivable – Government accounted for 10–17 percent, Inventory remained between 5 and 9 percent, and “Others” ranged from 11 to 16 percent. Unsecured collateral was minimal, recorded at 1–2 percent in later quarters. Control type showed a balanced split between Enhanced Monitoring and Standard Monitoring, with Enhanced Monitoring ranging from 29 to 31 percent, Standard Monitoring from 46 to 47 percent, and Others between 23 and 25 percent. Valuation method results mirrored the ABL distributions, with Net Orderly Liquidation Value around 79 percent, Net Forced at 9 percent, Fair Market at 10 percent, and Net Book Value at 2 percent.

Model use monitoring tracked obligation counts and commitments by quarter. ABL facilities declined from 256 obligations in 2024Q2 to 219 obligations in 2025Q1, with commitments decreasing from $13.5 billion to $11.6 billion over the same period. SF facilities expanded, increasing from 57 obligations in 2024Q2 to 82 obligations in 2025Q1, with commitments rising from $752 million to $1.37 billion. This provided a clear view of portfolio size and commitment changes.

The LGD risk rating distribution was reported quarterly, with total records ranging from 315 in 2024Q2 to 302 in 2025Q1. Grade A consistently represented the largest share but declined from 48 percent in 2024Q2 to 43 percent in 2025Q1. Other grades, including B, C, D, E, and F, remained stable with minor shifts across quarters.

Finally, default history was included to reconcile realized and estimated LGD. In 2024Q2, two defaults were recorded with $21.96 million in exposure and a realized LGD of 36.25 percent. In 2024Q3, one default was recorded with $32.0 million exposure and a realized LGD of 12.5 percent. Defaults increased in 2024Q4, with 13 events totaling $199.0 million in exposure and a realized LGD of 18.23 percent. No defaults were reported in 2025Q1.

In summary, the developer’s OGM reports included adequate data quality checks by covering input distributions, model use monitoring, risk rating distributions, and default history. These checks provided a consistent view of data composition and portfolio monitoring.


4.2.2Data Quality by MRO

MRO carried out a data quality review on the all_table dataset, which is the developer’s consolidated quarterly staging table used for OGM processing. This table brings together the core fields required for risk grading, exposure measurement, override analysis, and performance analysis. It contains the risk and grade information (TFC_rsk_grd, STI_lgd_grd_cd, final_grd, final_lgd_perc, model_lgd_perc, over_lgd_perc), the identifiers (TFC_primary_key, TFC_Account_Nbr, TFC_Account_Nbr_New, STI_group_id, c_obg, c_obl), exposure related attributes (TFC_Curr_Bal, tfc_face_amt, STI_BND_EXPOS_AMT), LOB segmentation variables (sti_lob_nm, STI_sub_lob_nm, business_group, legacy_bank_new), and other fields such as Override_Reason, util, and model_or_cmnts.
The developer’s OGM code constructs the all_table by pulling records from source tables, performing standardization of obligor and facility identifiers, and appending collateral information for secured finance. The process also includes combining Compass and non-Compass loans, aligning accounts with pre-merger legacy hSTI and hBBT, and attaching facility-level attributes. Developers also carried out deduplication steps using identifiers such as TFC_Account_Nbr_New, c_obg, and c_obl to ensure that each (obligor, facility) combination is uniquely represented in the dataset. Intermediate data checks are performed for duplicates, with flagged records removed through sorting with nodupkey logic.
As part of this dataset construction, the developer performed treatments for missing values and data gaps. For example, missing high account numbers were supplemented using PAD extracts, legacy bank assignment was filled based on account mapping, and collateral class assignments were derived from collateral control values. In several steps, missing or null values were handled through conditional logic to create valid identifiers and ensure completeness of the merged dataset.
Because the all_table serves as the unified input for OGM reporting, performance testing, and override monitoring, MRO reviewed its quality and appropriateness to assess the overall quality of OGM datasets before assessing downstream results. 

MRO reviewed the all_table datasets for 2024Q2 through 2025Q1. The purpose of this review was to identify potential errors in data, high concentrations in certain values, and the presence of duplicated or missing records. The descriptive analysis included continuous and categorical variables, with checks for outliers, missing values, and consistency.
2024Q2
The dataset contained 1,153 records and 439 distinct obligors. For continuous variables, current balances ranged from 0 to 866 million and face amounts ranged from 0 to 282 million. LGD percentages were centered at 7.5 percent, with maximum values up to 52 percent. Utilization values ranged between 0 and 1, with a 95th percentile of 0.87. For categorical variables, legacy bank distribution was Truist 52 percent, hSTI 47 percent, and hBBT 1 percent. Business group composition was ABL 77 percent, CCB Secured Finance 12 percent, and Commercial 6 percent. Missing values were concentrated in business group (11 records, about 1 percent of total) and sub-LOB (376 records, about 33 percent). Duplicates were identified in intermediate stages but removed in the final table. Analysis of outliers showed that the top 20 balances and face amounts carried extremely large exposures. These outliers reflected large exposures that were stable across periods and appeared reasonable within the dataset. Consistency checks showed that balances were non-negative, LGD percentages were within 0–100, utilization values were between 0 and 1, and categorical codes aligned with expected categories.
2024Q3
The dataset contained 1,168 records and 454 distinct obligors. Current balances ranged from 0 to 996 million and face amounts ranged from 0 to 434 million. LGD percentages showed a median of 7.5 percent with a maximum of 52 percent. Utilization values ranged from 0 to 1, with a 95th percentile of 0.87. Legacy bank distribution was Truist 52 percent, hSTI 47 percent, and hBBT 1 percent. Business group composition was ABL 75 percent, CCB Secured Finance 12 percent, and Commercial 6 percent. Missing values included 12 in business group (1 percent) and 382 in sub-LOB (33 percent). Deduplication ensured unique obligor-facility representation. Analysis of outliers indicated that a small set of accounts exceeded 900 million in balances. These exposures were stable across periods and considered reasonable given portfolio size. Consistency checks showed that continuous variables stayed within expected ranges, and categorical fields matched the expected set of codes.
2024Q4
The dataset contained 1,145 records and 447 distinct obligors. Current balances extended to 1.19 billion and face amounts reached 434 million. LGD percentages had a median of 7.5 percent and a maximum of 52.5 percent. Utilization ranged from 0 to 1, with a 95th percentile of 0.86. Legacy bank distribution was Truist 51 percent, hSTI 48 percent, and hBBT 1 percent. Business group composition was ABL 73 percent, CCB Secured Finance 14 percent, and Commercial 6 percent. Missingness included 11 records in business group (1 percent) and 379 in sub-LOB (33 percent). Deduplication ensured that no duplicates remained in the final tables. Analysis of outliers showed that the top 20 accounts carried balances above 900 million. These outliers reflected large exposures that were stable across periods and appeared reasonable within the dataset. Consistency checks indicated that balances, LGD percentages, utilization ratios, and categorical codes were all within sensible ranges.
2025Q1
The dataset contained 1,120 records and 441 distinct obligors. Current balances ranged up to 1.09 billion and face amounts up to 243 million. LGD percentages were stable, with a median of 7.5 percent and a maximum of 47 percent. Utilization values ranged from 0 to 1, with a 95th percentile of 0.86. Legacy bank distribution was Truist 52 percent, hSTI 47 percent, and hBBT 1 percent. Business group composition was ABL 73 percent, CCB Secured Finance 15 percent, and Commercial 6 percent. Missing values remained consistent with prior quarters, including 11 in business group (1 percent) and 379 in sub-LOB (34 percent). Deduplication ensured uniqueness of obligor-facility pairs. Analysis of outliers showed that a small number of accounts carried balances above 1 billion. These values were consistent with prior quarters and were determined to be valid exposures. Consistency checks showed that all continuous and categorical variables were within valid ranges, with no unreasonable values observed.
General Summary
Across 2024Q2 through 2025Q1, total records ranged from 1,120 to 1,168 and distinct obligors ranged from 439 to 454. Current balances and face amounts showed high concentrations in the largest facilities, but these patterns were stable over time and appeared reasonable within the dataset. LGD percentages were consistent with medians of 7.5 percent and maximums between 47 and 52.5 percent. Utilization values were bounded between 0 and 1, with 95th percentiles between 0.86 and 0.87. Legacy bank distributions were steady with Truist at 51–52 percent, hSTI at 47–48 percent, and hBBT at 1 percent. Business group composition was consistently dominated by ABL, with CCB Secured Finance and Commercial in smaller proportions. Missingness was limited to business group and sub-LOB variables, affecting about 1 percent and 33 percent of records respectively, and did not materially change across periods. Deduplication steps ensured that duplicates were removed before final analysis. Outlier review indicated that extreme values reflected large exposures that were stable across periods and appeared reasonable within the dataset. Consistency checks showed that all values observed were within sensible ranges. MRO concludes that the all_table data quality was adequate for OGM analysis.


4.2.1 data appropriateness testing by MD

The developer carried out testing to confirm the appropriateness of the data assumptions underlying MOD1497’s application to Secured Finance (SF) facilities. The key assumption is that the majority of SF exposures would be collateralized by Accounts Receivable (A/R), A/R-Government, or Inventory, and valued under Net Book Value (NBV). Monitoring was structured to measure the proportion of the SF portfolio (by count) covered under these categories, with thresholds set at 75 percent for acceptable coverage.
For 2024Q2, the portfolio distribution testing showed 55 out of 57 SF facilities secured by A/R, A/R-Government, or Inventory under NBV. This equated to 96 percent coverage, which exceeded the 75 percent acceptability threshold. The result was assessed as acceptable.
For 2024Q3, the developer reported 72 out of 75 SF facilities meeting the criteria, resulting in 96 percent coverage. This again exceeded the threshold, with the outcome assessed as acceptable.
For 2024Q4, 76 out of 78 SF facilities met the criteria, producing 97 percent coverage. The result was assessed as acceptable, and coverage showed consistency with the prior quarter.
For 2025Q1, 80 out of 82 SF facilities met the criteria, with coverage of 98 percent. This result also exceeded the 75 percent threshold and was assessed as acceptable.
Across all reported quarters, the developer’s monitoring confirmed that the SF portfolio composition aligned with the model’s design assumptions. Coverage consistently exceeded 95 percent, well above the required 75 percent level. The results demonstrate that the assumptions remain appropriate for the model’s continued use, with no stakeholder intervention triggered during the reporting periods.



4.2.2 data appropriateness testing by MRO
Data Cleaning MRO indepedentlu assessed the data preparation code logic as well as the code logic to prepare all_table dataset. 
The developer’s OGM code applies multiple steps of data cleaning. Duplicate records are checked and removed at several points using both proc sort nodupkey and proc sql with group by and having count greater than one. Where version identifiers and update timestamps are available, the code keeps the latest version by selecting maximum versionid or maximum dt_time. This ensures that only one record per entity and date is retained in the dataset. Records that are marked as deleted or not approved are excluded. Date fields are standardized using coalesce of update date and create date. The logic for building keys such as c_obgobl and account number variants is explicit.
Data Relevance The variables retained in the all_table and related collateral datasets were directly relevant to OGM monitoring. Key information included model, final, and override LGD values; balances, exposures, and face amounts; and identifiers at the obligor, facility, and account levels. Portfolio segmentation was supported through variables such as business_group, legacy_bank_new, sti_lob_nm, and sti_sub_lob_nm. The collateral build process created linkages between asset, collateral, and product tables, with duplication checks performed at each stage to maintain data integrity. The final dataset contained distinct counts of product, collateral, and asset identifiers, ensuring that collateral characteristics could be consistently tied to exposures. Overall, the data elements included in the final outputs aligned with the model’s risk rating objective and provided a complete basis for performance assessment.

Based on our review, the data sources used in the OGM process are appropriate for their purpose. The data sources are Moody’s Credit Lens schemes in the Netazza HUB and Loan Accounting Systems data from the Predictive Analytics Dataset (PAD). These sources are managed under established governance frameworks and subject to data controls set by the Enterprise Data and Analytics Office and EDO. The variables are obtained from official systems that are subject to established governance and control procedures. The sources are considered reliable and provide the information needed for ongoing monitoring. 

The developer applies data control practices throughout the OGM production. The code is automated in SAS to pull data directly from the controlled repositories, which minimizes manual handling and reduces the risk of errors. Duplicate checks and effective date filters are systematically applied to retain the latest valid records. Data flagged as deleted or not approved are excluded to maintain integrity. Usage and trending metrics are also applied to monitor reasonableness, such as verifying that balances and counts are consistent across reporting periods.

The control ID in place is CTR_XXXXX:


Further, model Developer establishes data quality and appropriateness by relying on certified system extracts and implementing validation steps in the data preparation code. Controls such as deduplication, approval status filters, effective date alignment, and linkage consistency checks are embedded into the processing routines. Final review steps are carried out by the Model Development managers, who confirm that the OGM dataset aligns with the model’s intended use and that the data quality is sufficient for ongoing monitoring.

MRO independently assessed these data sourcing practices and confirmed that the source variables are drawn from reliable sources. The review also confirmed that data controls are consistently applied and that Model Developmer has established reasonable practices to maintain the quality and appropriateness of the OGM dataset.



4.1.3 Data Quality Assessment
MRO evaluated the adequacy of the data quality analysis performed by the model developer and carried out an independent review of the all_table dataset. The all_table dataset serves as the consolidated quarterly staging table for OGM processing and is constructed from official source systems.

MRO confirmed that the developer’s checks covered input distributions, model use monitoring, risk rating distributions, and default history. For ABL input distributions, collateral class composition, control type, and valuation methods remained stable across quarters, with Accounts Receivable at 38–39 percent, Inventory at 31–33 percent, Monitored and Perfected Security Interest at 97 percent, and Net Orderly Liquidation Value at 79 percent. For Non-ABL input distributions, Accounts Receivable ranged from 62 to 67 percent, A/R-Government from 10 to 17 percent, Inventory from 5 to 9 percent, and Others from 11 to 16 percent, with control type balanced between Enhanced Monitoring (29–31 percent) and Standard Monitoring (46–47 percent). Model use monitoring showed declining ABL obligations from 256 in 2024Q2 to 219 in 2025Q1, while SF obligations rose from 57 to 82 over the same period. LGD risk rating distributions showed Grade A as the largest share, declining from 48 percent in 2024Q2 to 43 percent in 2025Q1. Default history reported two defaults in 2024Q2, one in 2024Q3, thirteen in 2024Q4, and none in 2025Q1.

Across 2024Q2 through 2025Q1, MRO observed stable distributions of key variables, including balances, face amounts, LGD percentages, and utilization ratios. Continuous variables such as balances, exposures, and LGD percentages were found to be within expected ranges, while categorical fields such as legacy bank, business group, and LOB codes aligned with valid domain values.

Based on this review, MRO concludes that the developer’s data quality analysis was adequate and that the all_table dataset provides a reliable and accurate basis for OGM reporting, override monitoring, and performance testing.

4.2.3 Data Appropriateness Assessment
MRO assessed the appropriateness of the data sources, data transformation, and data sampling applied by the developer in constructing the OGM dataset. The developer sources data from Moody’s Credit Lens schemes in the Netazza HUB and Loan Accounting Systems in PAD, which are certified systems governed by enterprise data controls. These systems are subject to established governance procedures under the Enterprise Data and Analytics Office and the Enterprise Data Office.

The OGM code includes systematic data transformation and control steps. Duplicate records are removed at multiple stages, effective date filters ensure retention of the latest valid record, and records flagged as deleted or unapproved are excluded. The code constructs obligor and facility keys explicitly and applies linkage checks across asset, collateral, and product tables to maintain internal consistency. Collateral information is appended to secured finance records, and identifiers are aligned across legacy institutions to ensure completeness.

The statistical validity of the data assumptions was confirmed by developer testing of the SF portfolio composition. Across 2024Q2 through 2025Q1, more than 95 percent of SF facilities were collateralized by Accounts Receivable, A/R-Government, or Inventory under Net Book Value, consistently exceeding the 75 percent acceptability threshold defined in the OGM plan. These results demonstrated that the data assumptions underlying MOD1497 remained valid.

MRO’s independent review confirmed that the data sources are appropriate, the transformations are reasonable, and the controls embedded in the code ensure integrity of the dataset. The dataset consistently aligned with the model’s design assumptions, and the appropriateness of the data was adequate to support ongoing OGM monitoring and performance assessment.
