Thanks, this is clear. Based on your documentation and the template screenshot, here’s a draft for **Section 1.1 Model Uses, Products and Exposures** and **1.2 Model History and Evolving Environment** in the same style/format.

---

### **1.1 Model Uses, Products and Exposures**

* The Sheffield PAG model has a single intended use of **pricing/valuation** for Sheffield PAG loans.
* The model is designed to forecast expected losses and provide loss-adjusted pricing consistent with portfolio risk.
* There are no other uses reported or validated beyond pricing/valuation.
* During this review, MRO confirmed with the Line of Business (LOB) that expected annual Sheffield PAG volume is approximately **\$50 million**, which establishes the scale of intended use.

### **1.2 Model History and Evolving Environment**

**1.2.1 Model History till Last Validation**

* The Sheffield PAG model (AH4953) was developed as a survival/hazard framework aligned with the existing Sheffield PS and OPE hazard models.
* The model leveraged Vantage Score 4.0 and TU Bankruptcy score as key credit drivers, replacing the historical FICO score used in the prior pricing model.
* The model was first validated upon development and implemented for Sheffield PAG pricing.
* There have been **limited to no PAG deals since 2019**, and thus no performance data have been available to conduct effective Ongoing Monitoring (OGM).

**1.2.2 Model Changes since Last Validation**

* No material methodology changes have been made to the Sheffield PAG model since the last validation.
* MRO reviewed all available OGM reports (2022Q2, 2022Q4, 2023Q4, and 2024Q4) and confirmed that no PAG deals were originated during these periods; therefore, no OGM testing results were produced.
* As part of this annual review, MRO requested the developer to confirm expected PAG volumes with the LOB. The LOB reported they expect **annual production of \$50 million in Sheffield PAG volume** going forward.

✅ This version mirrors your template (blue guidance turned into structured bullets/paragraphs).

Would you like me to also **add an explicit concluding line** (like “Based on MRO’s review, the model use and evolving environment are considered appropriate at this time”) to align with the style of the screenshots?
