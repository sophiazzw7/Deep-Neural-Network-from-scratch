The PS paydown model does not include macroeconomic drivers (e.g., unemployment rates/claims) because the developer did not identify an intuitive or stable relationship between those variables and paydown performance. While this rationale is documented, paydown rates would be expected to decline in deteriorating economic conditions and rise in benign conditions; excluding macroeconomic conditioning may therefore limit the modelâ€™s responsiveness under stress. The model documentation also did not provide exploratory data analysis to support the decision to omit macroeconomic variables. MRO views ongoing OGM monitoring as the compensating control; however, because there have been no PAG deals since 2019, empirical reassessment or model refresh has not been feasible. MRO will continue close monitoring and recommends that, once sufficient new data become available, the paydown model be refreshed to reassess macroeconomic sensitivity and conditioning.
