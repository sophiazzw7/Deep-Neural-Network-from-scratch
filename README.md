Subject: Follow-up on Form I-797 Approval Notice

Hi [Visa Team's Name],

Thank you for sharing the e-approval notice for my H-1B renewal. I wanted to kindly follow up and check if the physical Form I-797 approval notice has arrived. I’ll need the original notice to renew my driver’s license, so I’d really appreciate any updates you can share.

Thanks again for your help!

Best regards,
Phoebe Chen
