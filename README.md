Here’s the refined version with your instruction incorporated — using **“OGM period”** consistently, mentioning that **2024Q4 OGM** was used as an example, and that **data quality controls will continue in 2025Q2 and going forward**:

### Validation Assessment – Data Controls for OGM Data Documentation

MRO reviewed the model developer’s updates to Section 9.2.3 of the Model Development Document (MDD). The revised section now documents the general controls that will be performed on OGM data for each OGM period. These controls include confirming data completeness, verifying that production applications are correctly filtered to eligible populations, reviewing feature-level summary statistics, and comparing OGM data distributions to a defined baseline.

The developer notes that waterfall tables will continue to be used to show how application volumes reduce through each filter step (for example, from all production to auto-approved and funded populations). Feature statistics—such as minimum, maximum, mean, and percent missing—will be monitored for stability across OGM periods to identify potential data quality or population drift issues.

The 2024Q4 OGM analysis was used as an example to illustrate the control framework, including population filtering, variable summary checks, and comparison to baseline data. The developer also stated that similar quality control will be performed and summarized in the 2025Q2 OGM report and subsequent OGM periods.

MRO concludes that the updated documentation provides sufficient detail on the recurring OGM data controls, and the process is now clearly defined and repeatable for future OGM periods. Therefore, the prior sub-issue *“Data controls for OGM data are not documented”* is **closed**.
