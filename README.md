As we work toward closing the validation, I wanted to check with you on a few updates to the model risk tier table in the MDD:

Coverage – Can we update this to reflect LOB’s expectation (around $50M)?

Model Use – In SNOW it shows “pricing/valuation.” Would it make sense to align the MDD entry for consistency?

Data Availability/Stability – I noticed this is marked “Low.” Was that mainly due to the limited PAG deals recently? If so, could we update the table in the MDD to reflect that context?

If possible, it would be great to have these changes in place by 10/02, as we are aiming to close the validation then. Please let me know your thoughts.
