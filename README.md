(1) Sensitivity testing revealed significant parameter volatility in the severity models (e.g., a 47% shift in the ET7 Intercept under a –5% severity shock). MRO requests that the developer diagnose the root cause of this instability and quantify any downstream impact.
(2) Retaining the current CI-overlap test for frequency is concerning because even a 20% change in the underlying data still results in a “pass.” This indicates that the metric is too insensitive for frequency and does not function as an effective early-warning indicator. A tighter or alternative metric is needed for frequency stability.

(3) MRO also observed that all frequency parameters still show CI overlap under a 20% tail increase, and one-third of severity parameters overlap. This indicates that the CI-overlap threshold is too loose for detecting tail shifts and is not suitable as a combined metric for both stability and tail-drift detection. MRO recommends redesigning the metric for tail-drift evaluation and reserving CI-based methods only for parameter-estimation stability.
