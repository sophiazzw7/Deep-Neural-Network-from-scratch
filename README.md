**Subject:** Follow-up on MOD1497 Override Analysis

Hi \[Boss’s Name],

I wanted to get your thoughts on the developer’s recent analysis (attached in Amit’s email). Their results confirm that most material overrides (≈60–70%) are due to “Other Collateral Strengths,” and that repeated overrides account for about 30–50% of events across 2024Q2–2025Q1. While this aligns with our initial observations, the override reason coding appears too broad (e.g., “Other Collateral”), which limits our ability to identify specific drivers.

Given the current rebuild timeline (2027), my suggestion is to propose a compensating control in the form of a structured root-cause analysis, requiring more granular sub-reason coding so recurring themes can be tracked and monitored. If we do not receive further clarifications from MD before validation closes (around September 19th), I plan to raise this as a sub-issue in the report.

Please let me know if you have alternative suggestions or if there are any follow-ups you’d like me to pursue with the developer team.

Thanks,
Phoebe

Do you want me to make this slightly **softer in tone** (more exploratory) or **firmer** (flagging the control gap more assertively)?
