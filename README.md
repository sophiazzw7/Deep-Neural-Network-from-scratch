# Summary of Kevin’s Follow-Up Questions and Responses

This document provides written responses to the questions raised by Kevin during the LGD methodology review. Each question is listed with a concise identifier (Q1–Q5), followed by a full-sentence response and references to relevant documentation where applicable.

### **Q1: What methodology does the LGD model use—accounting loss or economic loss?**

**Answer:**
Upon reviewing internal documentation, including the Dual Risk Rating Policy, it is noted that LGD is defined as an estimate of *economic loss*. However, in practice, the implementation of MOD1497 aligns with an *accounting-based loss* definition. The LGD is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{LGD} = 1 - \frac{\text{Recoveries}}{\text{EAD}}
$$

There is no discounting of future recoveries or adjustment for indirect collection costs. Therefore, the model effectively reflects accounting losses rather than discounted economic losses.

### **Q2: How is EAD determined—modeled or rule-based—and is there any linkage to upstream/downstream calculations?**

**Answer:**
EAD values are determined through embedded rules within the LGD scorecard and are not generated by a separate model. For term loan products, EAD is assigned as a fixed percentage of commitment—typically 100%, 50%, or 25%—depending on the specific product characteristics. For revolvers, EAD is defined as the greater of: (1) 95% of the net borrowing base after applying all blocks and reserves, or (2) the outstanding balance. The final EAD value is then capped by the total commitment amount. These rules are applied directly within the scorecard logic and do not link to any upstream or downstream EAD model.

### **Q3: What does “Q1 2025” mean in the context of recovery timing—is it referring to default or resolution timing?**

**Answer:**
Q1 2025 refers to the **reporting cycle** for the OGM report. It does *not* imply that recoveries from defaults occurring in Q1 2025 are included. Rather, the default cohort window for LGD resolution ends at **Q3 2023**, as stated explicitly in the model performance assessment section:

> “The OGM data has cumulated 9 resolved default counts... ending at Q3 2023.”
> This is consistent with policy guidance indicating that resolved LGD requires approximately 3 to 14 quarters post-default for full recovery and charge-off realization. As a result, defaults within the last two years—i.e., post-Q3 2023—are still maturing and **excluded** from the Q1 2025 LGD results.

### **Q4: What is the definition of the SF (Secured Finance) portfolio, and how is it distinct from ABL?**

**Answer:**
The SF (Secured Finance) portfolio refers to **non-ABL borrowing base revolvers** that are secured by working capital assets but are structured to rely on the borrower's **cash flow** for repayment rather than collateral liquidation. SF obligations include types 233 (standard), 234 (enhanced), and 28, as outlined in the WHL-CD-600 *Secured Finance Lending Procedure*. Key differences between ABL and SF portfolios are as follows:

* **ABL** facilities involve high-intensity collateral monitoring (e.g., field exams, cash dominion) and assume repayment through asset liquidation. Collateral is valued at Net Orderly Liquidation Value (NOLV).
* **SF** facilities have moderate collateral oversight and are intended to be repaid through ongoing business operations. Collateral is typically valued at Net Book Value, and advance rates are more conservative (e.g., AR up to 80%, inventory up to 50%).

Representative SF products include middle-market business revolvers, business banking working capital lines, and certain wealth management credit facilities.

### **Q5: Can you provide a data dump for SF and ABL portfolios, including facility details and utilization pivots?**

**Answer:**
Three Excel files have been prepared and attached to this summary:

* **2024Q4\_InstrumentDump.xlsx**: Contains facility-level data as of Q4 2024, including borrower risk rating, LGD rating, collateral class, utilization, commitment, drawn amount, and obligation type.
* **2025Q1\_InstrumentDump.xlsx**: Same structure as above, with data as of Q1 2025.
* **Utilization\_Pivots.xlsx**: Includes two pivot plots:

  * **Utilization Rate by Borrower Risk Rating**
  * **Utilization Rate by Collateral Class** (where available)

No interpretive conclusions are drawn at this time; the data is provided in raw form for further analysis or discussion.
