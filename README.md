**Subject:** Follow-up on MOD1497 Root Cause Analysis and Repeat Overrides

Hi Amit and Jiao,

Hope you're doing well. Just following up on the root cause and repeat override analysis you mentioned would be available by mid this week—let us know if there's an update on timing.

Separately, MRO completed a quick repeat override analysis covering 2024Q2–2025Q1. Key findings (see attached tables for detail):

* **High repeat rate:** \~90–96% of material overrides each quarter are repeats (2024Q2 is baseline).
* **Upgrade skew:** Upgrades consistently exceed downgrades, suggesting directional bias.
* **Significant exposure:** \~22–25% of balances each quarter are under material overrides.
* **Concentrated reasons:** A small number of override reasons (e.g., codes 20, 21, 8, and “MISSING”) appear frequently across quarters. This suggests recurring override patterns, but MRO does not have access to the full reason code mapping, so we are unable to determine which specific business drivers (e.g., collateral-related, input adjustments) dominate.

These results suggest the need for compensating controls while redevelopment is pending. We recommend:

1. Maintaining a repeat override tracker for recurring obligors.
2. Conducting a basic root cause analysis of dominant override drivers once the code mapping is available.

We’ll include the override reason distribution chart in the appendix for context. Please let us know if you'd like to discuss further.

Best,
Phoebe

Do you want me to also draft a **caption/summary blurb** for each table (so when you attach them, the reader immediately knows what each one shows)?
