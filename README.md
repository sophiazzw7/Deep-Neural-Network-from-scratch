Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out regarding the recent performance of MOD13512. As noted in the OGM reports, the model was rated "red" in the Home Improvement segment for 2024Q2, "yellow" in the same segment for 2024Q4, and "red" overall in 2024Q4. These ratings reflect AUC breaches, indicating a sustained decline in the model’s discriminatory power.
Given these performance issues and knowing that the model rebuild would likely take around a year, I wanted to check if there are any compensating controls your team could implement in the meantime.

For example, would it be feasible to consider adjusting score cutoffs or modifying credit strategies to help manage risk exposure while the model remains in use?

Please let me know your thoughts, or if you prefer to discuss this in a meeting.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
