### Methodology Assessment for MOD 11783

MOD 11783 estimates the 12-month probability of default (PD) using logistic regression. This methodology remains appropriate for the wholesale portfolio, despite low default counts.

Logistic regression is widely accepted by regulators and is considered the industry standard for PD modeling. It produces continuous PD values bounded between 0 and 1 and provides interpretable coefficient effects. The model uses both internal and external credit attributes and is implemented using the SAS LOGISTIC procedure with maximum likelihood estimation.

Alternative methods were reviewed, including linear regression, discriminant analysis, panel models, and hazard models. These approaches have significant limitations such as unbounded outputs, strong distributional assumptions, or added complexity, making them less suitable in this setting.

Given its transparency, statistical robustness, and regulatory acceptance, logistic regression continues to be an appropriate methodology for MOD 11783.
