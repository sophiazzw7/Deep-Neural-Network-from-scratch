| **1. Accuracy Ratio / Gini Threshold Rationale**<br>• Original concern: No quantitative or SME-supported basis for the ≥ 40 % “Satisfactory” threshold.               | • In previour • Prior review (2024): 40 % was verbally justified as the “minimum acceptable” Accuracy-Ratio/Gini floor for wholesale PD models. MRO accepted the logic because:
 – Practitioner view: 0.60 is “good”, 0.40 is “acceptable”.
 – Wholesale default counts are thin, so a lower bound is reasonable.
 – Development Gini values ranged 0.53 – 0.73, i.e. safely above 0.40.
 However, the rationale and supporting citations were missing from the MDD/OGM Plan, so MRO raised a sub-issue (“…model development should add empirical analysis along with explaining expert judgement in providing relevant justification…”).The OGM Plan now includes a written rationale explaining why a 40 % Gini (Accuracy Ratio) floor is appropriate for PD models with thin-default wholesale portfolios.<br>• The rationale cites (i) data-set dependency of Gini, (ii) danger of false alarms when applying development-phase Gini to recent data, (iii) lower default incidence in wholesale vs. retail, and (iv) supporting academic literature.<br>• The threshold table (< 40 % = “Not Satisfactory”; ≥ 40 % = “ Satisfactory”; < 30 defaults = “NA”) has been embedded in Section 9.1 of the revised OGM Plan.<br>• While the justification remains qualitative, this meets the documentation requirement specified in the issue description; empirical back-testing of the threshold is not feasible given portfolio default scarcity and is explicitly addressed in the narrative. | **Addressed** |
| **2. Population Stability Index (PSI) Early-Warning Threshold**<br>• Original concern: 25 % PSI trigger lacked evidential support; MRO recommended a lower threshold. | • The revised OGM Plan lowers the Early-Warning trigger to **PSI > 0.10**, with ≤ 0.10 deemed “Acceptable”.<br>• A detailed explanation is provided: χ²-based derivation, baseline/target sample-size effects, industry conventions, and an Excel worksheet (PSI\_Threshold.xlsx) documenting the calculations.<br>• A data-sufficiency rule (no PSI if any bin < 14 obs) is included to avoid spurious alerts in thin portfolios.<br>• The new threshold and methodology align with MRO guidance and close the evidential gap cited in the finding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Addressed** |
