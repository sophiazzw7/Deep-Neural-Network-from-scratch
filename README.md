In PRISM Batch models, which run end-to-end with no user adjustments, the only rating changes come from an external model override: Portfolio Management re-scores a borrower in a separate model—often to reflect a Criticized/Classified credit decision or, less commonly, to correct a credit-bureau data issue—and uploads that new rating to replace the PRISM result. Because these overrides originate outside the automated batch flow, the usual user-interaction override thresholds do not apply. Instead, an external-override threshold was set by the Ongoing Monitoring work-stream, with effective challenge from the Model Risk Organization. This metric, which has no minimum observation requirement, is monitored on the same cadence as the OGM report.
