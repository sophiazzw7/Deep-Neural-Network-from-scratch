The QQ plots for both the frequency and severity models show that the fitted curve sits consistently above the empirical points at the tail. Please provide a brief explanation for the observed tail pattern in MDD.  
Please document the tail deviation as a model limitation with a mitigation plan.


Please include the definition of impermissible values in MDD.
Please include data linage work expected completion timeline in MDD.
Please provide quantitative testing why LDA is deemed unsuitable below the 1000 event threshold.

Please clarify the definition of tail used in sensitivity test(“tail increase by 10%”).

MRO notes that all frequency parameters still show CI overlap even under a 20% tail increase, and one-third of severity parameters overlap under the same stress. This indicates that the CI-overlap threshold is too loose and does not function well as an early-warning indicator of tail shifts. MRO recommends tightening the threshold or redesigning the metric to better capture meaningful changes in tail behavior.
