Model Methodology
The Sheffield PAG model employs a discrete-time proportional odds hazard framework estimated via logistic regression. This approach was selected after consideration of alternative specifications. Survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model and parametric hazard functions were evaluated but not adopted, as the monthly structure of the Sheffield data aligned more closely with a discrete-time logistic hazard, and logistic regression provided greater transparency, tractability, and interpretability for implementation and monitoring. A simple roll-rate framework was also considered but was determined to be less accurate and less flexible in capturing the joint impact of borrower risk drivers.
Within the adopted framework, default and paydown are modeled as competing risks, jointly determining surviving balances over time. Observations are treated as independent Bernoulli trials, and censoring is incorporated through binomial probability assumptions. The proportional odds structure allows relative effects of predictors to be constant across time, while the baseline hazard intercept governs absolute levels.
Segmentation was introduced between the Powersports and Outdoor Power Equipment portfolios to capture differences in borrower characteristics and product risk. Key predictor variables include Vantage Score 4.0, TransUnion Bankruptcy Score, origination LTV, term length, product category, and vintage indicators to address historic data limitations in earlier cohorts. The selected predictors were tested for statistical significance, stability, and collinearity, with final coefficients demonstrating strong explanatory power and alignment of observed versus predicted hazard rates in development.
Loss severity is estimated separately by decomposing LGD into roll rates and recovery rates, applied as scalars to portfolio balances. Alternative specifications incorporating macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment were considered but found to contribute little to explanatory power and were excluded from the final design. This results in a parsimonious, stable, and interpretable severity structure, albeit with limited explicit responsiveness to macroeconomic shocks.
Assessment of Reasonableness The methodology remains unchanged from its initial development and prior reviews, which validated its conceptual soundness and empirical fit. MRO notes that continued soundness cannot be directly tested through ongoing monitoring at this time, as there have been no new PAG deals since 2019 and thus no performance results available in recent OGM periods. Nevertheless, the design remains transparent, statistically supported, and appropriate for its intended purpose. The framework balances interpretability and predictive accuracy, segmentation aligns with portfolio structure, and the predictor set continues to be conceptually relevant.
