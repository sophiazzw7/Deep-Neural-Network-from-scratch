Independent Model-Risk-Oversight (MRO) Performance Assessment Model ID MOD13512 — LightStream Probability-of-Default Model Review period: Operating-Go-Live data for 2024 Q2

1 Scope of the review
The MRO team carried out a fully independent performance examination of MOD13512 using the complete 2024 Q2 production extract. The file contains 214 159 loan applications, of which 3 808 subsequently defaulted; the resulting realised event rate is 1.78 percent. All calculations in this report were produced by MRO analysts with new code executed on the raw production data set, thereby providing a clean cross-check of the developer’s own monitoring.

2 Discrimination capability
To measure how effectively the model separates defaulting from non-defaulting exposures, MRO generated receiver-operating-characteristic curves, cumulative-accuracy-profile curves, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics and Gini coefficients for each of the business-critical loan-purpose segments. The key results are reproduced below in sentence form for clarity:
* For Home Improvement loans the area under the ROC curve (AUC) equals 0.72, the KS statistic equals 0.33 and the Gini coefficient equals 0.44.
* For Auto loans the corresponding values are an AUC of 0.75, a KS of 0.39 and a Gini of 0.50.
* The Other-purpose segment records an AUC of 0.70, a KS of 0.33 and a Gini of 0.39.
* The Debt Consolidation segment shows an AUC of 0.69, a KS of 0.29 and a Gini of 0.37.
In every segment the ROC and CAP curves generated by MRO lie well above the reference diagonal, confirming that the model continues to provide useful rank ordering of credit risk. None of the discrimination statistics fall below the firm’s internal alert thresholds, and no evidence of material drift is observed within the review period.

3 Classification behaviour
The production score-to-action mapping in force during the quarter assigns virtually every application to the “non-default” class. This policy yields overall accuracy close to 98 percent, but both precision and recall measure at zero because no accounts are flagged as likely defaults.
To explore whether a less extreme cut-off can deliver a more balanced trade-off, MRO performed a grid search for the probability threshold that maximises the F1 score in each segment. The optimal thresholds and the associated confusion-matrix metrics are summarised below in narrative form:
* When a probability cut-off of 5.2 percent is applied to Home Improvement loans, accuracy becomes 88 percent, precision 6 percent, recall 33 percent, F1 10 percent and specificity 89 percent.
* A cut-off of 4.6 percent for Auto loans also yields 88 percent accuracy; precision and recall are 4 percent and 33 percent respectively, producing an F1 score of 7 percent and specificity of 89 percent.
* For the Other-purpose segment a threshold of 7.2 percent results in 88 percent accuracy, 4 percent precision, 26 percent recall, 7 percent F1 and 89 percent specificity.
* For Debt Consolidation loans a threshold of 8.4 percent achieves 88 percent accuracy, 5 percent precision, 25 percent recall, 8 percent F1 and 89 percent specificity.
Across all segments the area under the precision–recall curve lies between 0.04 and 0.05, a range that is fully consistent with the 1.78 percent base default rate and therefore indicates no hidden loss of model resolution.

4 Operational soundness checks
MRO complemented the statistical tests with several operational diagnostics to verify that model outputs align with business processing realities:
* The overall funding rate stands at 98.64 percent. Primary applications fund at 98.46 percent and secondary applications at 99.51 percent. Funding rates by loan purpose are tightly clustered: 98.42 percent for Home Improvement, 98.91 percent for Auto, 98.61 percent for Other and 98.48 percent for Debt Consolidation.
* The time-to-fund distribution is right-skewed; while isolated transactions take as long as one hundred days to fund, the bulk of loans disburse within only a few days, echoing established LightStream operational patterns.
* The correlation between funding latency and funded amount is negligible at approximately 0.03, indicating that model scores do not introduce unintended bias toward either faster or slower processing of larger balances.
* The score distribution retains its expected right skew, and a side-by-side box-plot confirms that predicted probabilities are materially higher for accounts that actually defaulted, providing another qualitative affirmation of score integrity.

5 Conclusion and recommendation
The independent MRO review finds no evidence of material deterioration in MOD13512 during 2024 Q2. Discriminatory power remains well within approved limits, and all examined operational metrics fall in normal ranges. The only notable shortcoming is that the current production threshold delivers zero recall. MRO therefore recommends that the segment-level probability cut-offs identified in Section 3 be tabled at the next Model Governance Committee, or that an equivalent compensating-control plan be adopted, so that recall can be increased without unduly sacrificing approval-rate objectives.
Following any change to the cut-off policy, MRO will repeat this test programme on the next quarterly data set to confirm that precision, recall and associated risk appetite targets continue to be met.







1 Scope of the review The MRO team carried out a fully independent performance examination of probability-of-default model MOD13512 using the complete 2024 Q4 OGM production extract for the Lightstream portfolio. The file contains 92 815 loan applications, of which 3 195 subsequently defaulted, giving an observed default rate of approximately 3.4 percent. All calculations in this report were produced by MRO analysts with new code executed on the raw production data set.
2 Discrimination capability To assess how effectively the model separates defaulting from non-defaulting exposures, MRO generated receiver-operating-characteristic curves, cumulative-accuracy-profile curves, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics and Gini coefficients for each business-critical loan-purpose segment. The main results are:
* For Home Improvement loans the area under the ROC curve (AUC) equals 0.71, the KS statistic equals 0.32 and the Gini coefficient equals 0.41.
* For Auto loans the corresponding values are an AUC of 0.75, a KS of 0.39 and a Gini of 0.50.
* The Other-purpose segment records an AUC of 0.68, a KS of 0.30 and a Gini of 0.36.
* The Debt Consolidation segment shows an AUC of 0.68, a KS of 0.28 and a Gini of 0.35.
In every segment the ROC and CAP curves sit above the random reference diagonal, and none of the discrimination statistics fall below the bank’s internal alert thresholds. No material drift is observed within the review period.
3 Classification behaviour MRO performed a grid search to find the probability cut-off that maximises the F1 score in each segment and then calculated the associated confusion-matrix metrics:
* A cut-off near 5.5 percent for Home Improvement loans yields accuracy 0.873, precision 0.116, recall 0.311, F1 0.169 and specificity 0.897.
* A cut-off around 4.7 percent for Auto loans produces accuracy 0.879, precision 0.081, recall 0.325, F1 0.129 and specificity 0.895.
* For the Other-purpose segment a cut-off close to 5.0 percent gives accuracy 0.775, precision 0.057, recall 0.447, F1 0.102 and specificity 0.784.
* For Debt Consolidation loans a cut-off near 6.8 percent results in accuracy 0.773, precision 0.081, recall 0.444, F1 0.138 and specificity 0.787.
Applying a single global threshold across the full portfolio gives overall accuracy 0.648, precision 0.063, recall 0.663, F1 0.115 and specificity 0.647. Precision–recall curves for the segments show areas between 0.05 and 0.09, a range consistent with the 3.4 percent event rate.
4 Operational soundness checks Additional diagnostics confirm that model outputs align with day-to-day processing realities:
* The overall funding rate is 96.89 percent. Primary applications fund at 96.53 percent and secondary applications at 98.58 percent.
* Funding rates by loan purpose are tightly grouped: 96.27 percent for Home Improvement, 97.52 percent for Auto, 97.37 percent for Other and 96.30 percent for Debt Consolidation.
* The time-to-fund distribution is right-skewed; most loans disburse within a few days, though a small tail extends to roughly one hundred days.
* The correlation between funding latency and funded amount is negligible at approximately 0.04, indicating that model scores do not introduce unintended bias toward faster or slower processing of larger balances.
* The score distribution is right-skewed with a mean of 0.028 and a maximum of 0.235, and box-plots show higher predicted probabilities for accounts that actually defaulted. No unexpected missing data or extreme outliers are present.
5 Conclusion and recommendation Independent MRO testing finds no evidence of material deterioration in MOD13512 during 2024 Q4. Discrimination statistics remain within approved limits, and operational metrics fall in normal ranges. Segment-optimised cut-offs deliver balanced recall and specificity, while precision remains modest, as expected for a portfolio with a low default rate.
The model can continue in production without immediate recalibration. Routine quarterly monitoring should be maintained, with particular attention to the Other and Debt Consolidation segments, which sit at the lower end of the AUC range. MRO will repeat this test programme on the next quarterly data set to verify that discrimination, calibration and operational behaviour remain stable and to detect promptly any emerging changes in model performance.
