MRO’s validation identified repeated breaches of the override threshold, driven primarily by persistent use of the “Other Collateral Strengths” reason code within the ABL segment. Through independent analysis, MRO confirmed that overrides are concentrated in a limited set of facility-level factors such as cross-collateralization, borrowing base utilization, and dealer finance receivables. MRO also confirmed that approximately 5% of ABL exposures in the past four OGM periods were unsecured, which conceptually deviates from the collateralized nature of ABL lending. These issues reflect structural design limitations rather than data or monitoring gaps.

Compensating controls, including the increase of OGM frequency, mitigate near-term risk by enhancing transparency; however, they do not resolve the underlying design weaknesses. MRO did not raise a new risk item given that an Archer finding is already in place and the model is undergoing redevelopment. Instead, MRO recommended that the redesign explicitly incorporate treatment of unsecured loans and systematically capture recurring collateral drivers such as cross-collateralization, borrowing base practices, and dealer finance receivables.

The developer subsequently provided a detailed root cause analysis in the file “MOD1497_OGM_2024Q2–2025Q1 Override Analysis.xlsx”, which summarized overrides tagged under “Other Collateral Strengths” across 2024Q2 to 2025Q1. The analysis showed that overrides reflected a broad mix of drivers, including both routine ABL monitoring practices and facility-specific collateral factors.

In 2024Q2, explanations included standard ABL monitoring and advance rates, frequent inventory appraisals and field exams, insured accounts receivable concentrations, and debtor diversification with no significant concentrations. Facility-specific factors also appeared, such as cross-collateralization with other ABL facilities, high recovery value for dealer finance receivables, PPP guarantees, collateral performing well despite not being appraised, and cases where inventory was not appraised but considered readily liquid. Some overrides referenced unsecured exposures where collateral was housed under the current facility but not fully reflected in model inputs.

In 2024Q3 and 2024Q4, similar themes continued, with overrides citing annual and semi-annual rolling stock appraisals, strong receivables from well-known counterparties, and broad monitoring practices. Other explanations included reserves for mark-to-market exposure, collateralized structures that were not systematically recognized, and additional references to collateral performance supporting higher recoveries.

In 2025Q1, the same categories of explanations persisted. Overrides were again attributed to cross-collateralization, dealer finance receivables, and rolling stock appraisals. One case involved a supply chain finance facility where the exposure was initially unsecured but Truist retained the contractual right to obtain security by providing notice to the agent and company.

Overall, the developer’s analysis showed that overrides under “Other Collateral Strengths” were not tied to a single driver but instead reflected a mix of recurring monitoring practices, collateral types not fully captured in the model, and facility-specific adjustments such as guarantees, appraisal practices, and borrowing base considerations.
