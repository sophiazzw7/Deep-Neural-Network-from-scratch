Got it — here’s a refined draft with explicit mention of reason code 20:

---

Hi Kevin,

I wanted to share my observations from reviewing the developer’s follow-up analysis on the G–K overrides. Totals across 2024Q2–2025Q1 show 36 items under reason code 20 (“Other Collateral Strengths”):

* PPP government guarantee: 9 (25.0%) — all in 2024Q2
* Unsecured / “collateral housed at the current” or similar: 7 (19.4%) — seen each quarter
* Cross-collateralized with ABL / cross-defaulted: 4 (11.1%)
* High recovery value for dealer-finance receivables: 4 (11.1%)
* Obtain semi-annual rolling-stock appraisals / tighter advance treatment: 3 (8.3%)
* Collateral appraised at \$14,332MM OLV (and availability effects): 2 (5.6%)
* Collateral performs well despite no appraisal: 2 (5.6%)
* Inventory not appraised but liquid, quick sale expected: 1 (2.8%)
* Mark-to-market exposure reserved from borrowing base: 1 (2.8%)
* A/R is strong, well-known buyers (above-average collateral): 1 (2.8%)
* SCF facility unsecured but bank retains right to obtain security: 1 (2.8%)

This breakdown shows that overrides coded as “Other Collateral Strengths” were primarily tied to collateral quality, monitoring, or treatment, rather than guarantees alone. That seems different from our last discussion, where you noted the main issue might be third-party guarantees not being reflected in the LGD assignment. Do you think this points to a broader collateral recognition gap in the model design, or are you comfortable with the developer’s explanation?

Also, before I finalize the draft validation report, I’d like to take a bit more time to carefully incorporate the developer’s responses instead of rushing. I may not have it ready by Thursday as planned, but I expect to have a solid draft to you by Friday or early next week. Would that timing work for you?

Thanks,
Phoebe

Would you like me to also phrase the “collateral recognition gap” as a **potential sub-issue** to make it clear that’s how you’re thinking about documenting it?
