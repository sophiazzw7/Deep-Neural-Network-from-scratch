Thanks! Here's an updated version that clarifies the data are from the vendor, while still keeping the tone polite and complete:

**Subject:** Follow-Up on Vendor Data and Validation Questions

Hi \[Name],

I’m following up on the OGM datasets from the vendor and the pending questions I sent over last week and the week before. I understand things can get busy, but I haven’t heard back yet and wanted to check in, especially as we’re working with a relatively short timeline for the annual validation.

We’re targeting to conclude the validation around the first week of July, so it would be very helpful to receive the data and any responses when available.

Please let me know if you need me to resend anything or clarify any part of the request. I appreciate your help!

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
