Developer’s OGM Assessment
The developer’s OGM reports for 2024Q2 through 2025Q1 assessed override performance using their standard thresholds. At the aggregated portfolio level, material override rates were 18.2% in 2024Q2 (rated Poor), 12.1% in 2024Q3 (Satisfactory), 11.7% in 2024Q4 (Satisfactory), and 11.9% in 2025Q1 (Satisfactory). At the ABL sub-portfolio level, material override rates were consistently above the 15% threshold, with results of 23.2% in 2024Q2, 16.8% in 2024Q3, 16.0% in 2024Q4, and 17.2% in 2025Q1. All four quarters were therefore assessed as Poor under the developer’s framework. In contrast, the non-ABL portfolio showed materially lower override rates (between 1.3% and 2.6% across quarters), all of which were rated Satisfactory.
For override magnitude, developer testing found average magnitudes within ±1 notch across all quarters and test levels. For example, in 2025Q1 the aggregated portfolio had an average override magnitude of –0.13 and ABL had –0.25, both assessed as Satisfactory.


Model Override Performance Analysis
MRO independently assessed override performance across 2024Q2–2025Q1 using developer datasets, with focus on override direction, concentration, and exposure share.

Across all quarters, upgrades consistently outnumbered downgrades. The same pattern was observed when looking at material overrides. For example, in 2024Q2 there were 40 downgrades and 45 upgrades, of which 19 upgrades and 11 downgrades were material. In 2024Q3 there were 42 downgrades and 31 upgrades, with 19 material upgrades and 10 material downgrades. This pattern continued in 2024Q4 and 2025Q1. The persistent skew toward upgrades suggests that the model may be conservative in some areas, or that certain risk mitigants, such as collateral or guarantees, are not fully reflected in the model outputs and are subsequently corrected through overrides.

Material overrides also accounted for a meaningful portion of the portfolio by exposure. While the number of material overrides each quarter was modest, their impact on exposure was significant. Face amount shares of material overrides ranged from approximately 13 percent to 20 percent, while balance shares ranged from approximately 24 percent to 25 percent. This indicates that material overrides are concentrated in larger obligors and therefore have an outsized effect on portfolio-level outcomes.

The distribution of material overrides was not uniform across heritage banks. Overrides were consistently higher in the hSTI and Truist cohorts, where rates reached around 27 percent and 20 percent in 2024Q2 and remained in the mid-teens to 20 percent range in later quarters. By contrast, hBBT showed minimal material override activity. These differences suggest that process or data lineage factors at the heritage level may play a role in driving the results.

At the line-of-business level, most material overrides occurred within Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment Banking. Certain sub-LOBs recorded particularly high rates. For example, Commercial Banking – Geog CML Banking reached a material override rate of 33 percent in 2024Q2, while some “missing” sub-LOB categories recorded rates around 29 percent. Corporate and Investment Banking also contained pockets of high rates, such as Industry Practice Groups, though in that case the counts were very small. The presence of high rates in some sub-LOBs, combined with missing values, suggests that both business mix and process gaps may be contributing factors.

Reason code reporting showed concentration in a small set of categories. For instance, code 20 and code 21 accounted for large portions of material overrides in multiple quarters. However, MRO was not able to independently assess the detailed mapping of override reason codes, since this information was not provided. Instead, MRO shared its observations with the developers and requested clarification on the specific codes. 

Overall, MRO’s analysis shows that override activity is not evenly distributed and is shaped by systematic factors. Overrides are more often upgrades than downgrades, they consistently affect high-exposure obligors, they are concentrated in specific heritage banks and business lines, and they rely heavily on a narrow set of override reason codes. The lack of transparency in how these reason codes are defined or applied limits independent assessment.

After MRO shared its independent analysis, the developer team completed and provided their own assessment covering 2024Q2 through 2025Q1. Their results confirmed that the override pattern is broadly consistent with what MRO observed. Specifically, the developers found that the majority of overrides (around 60–70%) were upgrades, with most attributed to the reason code “Other Collateral Strengths.”
The developer analysis also addressed persistence of overrides across quarters. By stacking material override events across the four quarters, they reported:
* 69 unique rating events, of which 34 were repeat overrides, resulting in an estimated 49% impact.
* 50 unique obligors with material overrides, of which 15 obligors had repeat overrides, resulting in a 30% obligor-level impact.
Their quarter-by-quarter review showed override volumes of 44 in 2024Q2, 29 in 2024Q3, 26 in 2024Q4, and 25 in 2025Q1, which aligns with the counts MRO identified. In each quarter, the developer analysis confirmed that upgrades consistently outnumbered downgrades, with upgrades accounting for roughly two-thirds of total overrides.


MRO critically assessed this analysis and noted that, while the overall override patterns were consistent, questions remain regarding the treatment of guarantees in the LGD assignment. Exposures with LGD ratings in the G-K range continued to appear within the ABL portfolio, despite ABL lending generally requiring collateral. This raised concerns that the mitigating effect of third-party guarantees may not be fully incorporated into the LGD ratings, even though overrides coded under “Other Collateral Strengths” may suggest their presence. MRO further observed that the use of “Other Collateral Strengths” as a reason code is broad and ambiguous, making it unclear whether guarantees are consistently included in this category or whether it is intended to capture unrelated adjustments. MRO raised a sub-issue.
