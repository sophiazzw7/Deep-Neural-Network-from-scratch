As part of the annual review, MRO requested the most recent MCA for AH4953. The developer confirmed that the prior MCA had been stored in MIMS but could not be located in SNOW, and no copy was available. MRO also confirmed with the governance team that the form could not be retrieved. As a result, MRO requested that the developer re-submit the MCA.

During this process, MRO noted that the MDD continued to reference approximately $1B in annual PAG volumes prior to 2019, despite the absence of PAG deals since that time. Follow-up with the line of business indicated current expectations of approximately $50M in annual PAG volumes. MRO asked the developer to update the MCA to reflect this revised coverage and ensure consistency across documentation.

The developer subsequently re-submitted the MCA and provided an updated MDD. The revised documentation corrected the coverage entry, aligned the stated model use to consistently include pricing/valuation, and clarified that the “Low” data availability designation reflected limited PAG activity in recent years.

MRO concludes that the model risk tier assessment and component ratings are now appropriately documented in both the MCA and MDD. The discrepancies identified during review have been addressed through the updates completed by the developer.
