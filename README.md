There were no changes to the threshold itself. The previous table illustration had simply omitted PRISM grades 15â€“17. The developer has now updated the illustration to include the missing ratings. This was not a change in methodology, but a minor correction to align the table with what was already reflected in the Absolute Error Analysis Excel, where the full range of grades was available.
