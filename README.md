Sensitivity testing shows inconsistent behavior across model components: frequency parameters change very little even under large shocks, while several severity parameters shift substantially (e.g., the ET7 Intercept moves ~47% under a –5% shock). Together, this suggests the model is too insensitive on the frequency side and too volatile on the severity side. MRO requests that the developer investigate the cause of this imbalance and assess any downstream impact.
