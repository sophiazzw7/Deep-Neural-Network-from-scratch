Data Quality Assessment

MRO was not able to conduct independent data quality testing on production data because there have been no Sheffield PAG deals in the 2022Q2, 2022Q4, 2023Q4, or 2024Q4 OGM periods. In place of production testing, MRO reviewed the data quality controls documented in the model development document and requested supporting evidence from the developer.

The model documentation specifies that OGM relies on upstream sources including the RED-C data mart and Moody’s macroeconomic scenarios, with data reconciliation and control checks performed on a recurring basis. Evidence provided by the developer confirmed that the Treasury DO team conducts monthly GL-Reconciliation of RED-C balances for charge-offs, recoveries, and net asset value, with results compared against the general ledger. The May 2025 reconciliation reports were shared, showing variance analyses across lines of business. All variances were small in dollar terms and within the tolerance thresholds defined in the reports, and manual adjustments were clearly documented.

For macroeconomic inputs, the developer provided reports from the RQCRA production team covering the March and June 2025 baseline and pessimistic scenarios. The reports included variance checks on historical and forecasted macroeconomic variables, with results presented in tabular form and supported by graphical plots. The evidence showed that key variables such as unemployment rate, unemployment claims, consumer credit, retail sales, and housing indices were subject to quality review, with large variances identified and reported.

Taken together, the reconciliation results and macroeconomic scenario checks demonstrate that data quality controls are operating as designed. While no PAG portfolio data were available for direct testing, the evidence reviewed indicates that key upstream processes and reconciliations are functioning with results within tolerance.

Data Appropriateness

Due to the absence of PAG deal activity in recent OGM periods, MRO was unable to assess the appropriateness of production inputs through independent testing. Instead, MRO reviewed the developer’s evidence of ongoing data control processes.

The GL-Reconciliation materials for charge-offs, recoveries, and net asset value showed that reported balances from RED-C were consistently reconciled to the general ledger. Net variances were small, documented, and within defined tolerance thresholds. These results suggest that the financial data feeding the model remain appropriate for use.

For macroeconomic inputs, the RQCRA quality control reports confirmed that scenario data are subject to structured variance checks against historical trends and forecast expectations. The baseline and pessimistic scenario reviews covered a wide set of variables relevant for credit risk modeling, with variance levels reported transparently. These processes support the appropriateness of macroeconomic drivers used in the model.

PSI monitoring was also referenced in the model documentation as a control for input stability. However, because no PAG portfolio data have been available since 2022, no PSI results could be produced for review. This remains a limitation, but it does not affect the appropriateness of the reconciliations and macroeconomic scenario checks that were reviewed.

Based on the evidence provided, MRO concludes that while the absence of PAG portfolio data prevents direct testing, the available reconciliation and scenario control processes support the appropriateness of the inputs relied upon by the model.
