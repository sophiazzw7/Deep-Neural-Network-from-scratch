Hi Kevin,

Just following up on my earlier note. Given the broad use of “Other Collateral Strengths” and the high share of repeat overrides, do you think adding more granular sub-reason coding and structured root-cause analysis each OGM cycle is a reasonable interim step until the rebuild? Please let me know if you’d suggest a different approach.

Thanks,
Sophia
