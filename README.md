Stability testing was carried out using two early warning indicators: the directional shift metric and the population stability index (PSI). These measures assess whether rating distributions and key model inputs remain stable over time.

For the directional shift metric, the OGM plan defines a threshold of greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0 as a material rating shift, while values between -1.0 and 1.0 indicate balanced rating migrations. Results across 2024Q2 through 2025Q1 consistently fell within the balanced range. In 2024Q2, the ABL sample showed a directional shift of -0.08, and in 2024Q3 the result was -0.06. By 2024Q4, the shift was -0.09, and in 2025Q1 it was -0.34. All of these values confirm that rating movements did not create a material directional bias.

For the PSI metric, the OGM plan defines values less than or equal to 0.25 as acceptable population shifts and values greater than 0.25 as significant shifts requiring attention. Across all quarters, most segments returned “NA – insufficient count in buckets,” reflecting that distributions were too thin to produce conclusive PSI values. Where results were available, they indicated acceptable shifts. For example, in 2024Q4 the non-ABL control type reported a PSI value of 0.054, and in 2025Q1 the non-ABL control type returned a PSI value of 0.038. Both were assessed as acceptable. Other inputs, including collateral class and valuation method across ABL and non-ABL portfolios, did not meet the minimum thresholds for evaluation.

Taken together, the results suggest that directional stability has been maintained, with no evidence of sustained rating drift. However, the limited PSI coverage across quarters restricts the ability to fully validate the stability of key model inputs. The findings underscore the dependence on directional shift as the primary stability measure, with PSI testing providing only partial assurance due to data limitations.
