I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share that Iâ€™ve recently received an internal promotion from Quantitative Validation Officer I (Grade 110) to Quantitative Validation Officer II (Grade 111) within the same team and job function.

The responsibilities remain largely consistent. Since my PERM case is currently in process and may be under DOL review soon, I wanted to check whether this promotion could affect the existing PWD or filing.
