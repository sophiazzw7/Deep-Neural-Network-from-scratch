#### 4. Model Evaluation Metrics

##### 4.1. ROC Curve and AUC

**ROC Curve:** The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.

**AUC:** The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is 0.726, indicating moderate model performance. This value is somewhat lower than expected for a robust model and suggests room for improvement. Critical evaluation revealed a significant gap between OGM performance (2023Q2-2024Q1) and development performance, leading to a discussion with developers for a recalibration plan.

##### 4.2. KS Statistic

**KS Statistic:** The maximum difference between the cumulative distribution of the positives and negatives is 0.357. A higher KS statistic is desired to indicate better discriminatory power.

##### 4.3. Gini Coefficient

**Gini Coefficient:** The Gini coefficient is 0.452, which measures inequality among values of a frequency distribution. This moderate value suggests that the model has some predictive power but is not highly effective in separating the classes.

##### 4.4. Precision-Recall Curve and Optimal Threshold

To find a better classification threshold, we plotted the Precision-Recall curve and evaluated the F1 score at various thresholds. The threshold that maximizes the F1 score was identified as the optimal threshold for balancing precision and recall, given the imbalanced dataset.

The optimal threshold was determined to be 0.0700518.

##### 4.5. Confusion Matrix and Derived Metrics

With the updated optimal threshold, the model's performance metrics are as follows:

| Metric     | Value         |
|------------|---------------|
| Accuracy   | 0.899425      |
| Precision  | 0.0400646     |
| Recall     | 0.238349      |
| F1 Score   | 0.06859       |
| Specificity| 0.90986       |

### 5. Additional Analyses

##### 5.1. Correlation Matrix

**Insight:** The correlation matrix reveals significant correlations between certain variables. For instance, a high correlation between `FUNDEDAMOUNT` and `BEST_SCORE` suggests that higher credit scores are associated with larger loan amounts. Additionally, latency (time taken to process the loan) shows a weak correlation with the `BEST_SCORE`, indicating that score does not significantly impact processing time.

##### 5.2. Time to Fund Distribution

**Insight:** The time to fund distribution shows a concentration around certain time periods, indicating potential operational bottlenecks. Identifying and addressing these bottlenecks could enhance the efficiency of loan processing and funding.

##### 5.3. Score vs. Target Bar Plot

**Insight:** The bar plot of scores versus the target variable highlights that lower credit scores are more frequently associated with defaults. This validates the predictive power of the `BEST_SCORE` variable in identifying high-risk applicants.

##### 5.4. Latency Distribution

**Insight:** The latency distribution reveals that the majority of loans are processed within a short time frame, but there are outliers with significantly higher processing times. These outliers could be investigated further to improve overall processing efficiency.

##### 5.5. Loan Purpose Analysis

**Insight:** Analysis of loan purposes shows varied default rates across different purposes. For example, loans for debt consolidation have a slightly higher default rate compared to other purposes. This indicates a need for more stringent evaluation criteria for specific loan purposes to mitigate risk.

##### 5.6. Score Distribution

**Insight:** The score distribution indicates a skewed distribution with most scores concentrated in the higher range. This could suggest a potential bias in the scoring system, necessitating a review of the scoring criteria to ensure it accurately reflects applicants' creditworthiness.

##### 5.7. Statistics of BEST_SCORE

**Insight:** Key statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the `BEST_SCORE` show a central tendency towards higher scores with some variability. The high mean and median scores suggest that most applicants have good credit scores, but the presence of outliers highlights the need for a robust risk assessment framework.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations

**Observations:**
- The funding rate is high across different application types and loan purposes, indicating that the model's predictions align well with actual funding decisions.
- The ROC AUC and Gini coefficients suggest moderate model performance. There is potential for significant improvement in these areas.
- The low precision indicates that the model produces many false positives, which can be problematic in a real-world scenario. This is evident from the sharp drop in the precision-recall curve.
- The recall rate is relatively high, meaning the model captures a good portion of the actual defaults but at the cost of a high false positive rate.

**Concerns:**
1. **Model Stability:** The moderate values of the ROC AUC and Gini coefficients suggest that the model might not be stable across different datasets or over time. This requires further investigation and potentially more robust model training.
2. **Performance on Imbalanced Data:** The model struggles with precision due to the imbalance in the dataset. While recall is acceptable, the precision is too low, indicating many false positives. This imbalance needs addressing through techniques like SMOTE or adjusting the classification threshold.
3. **Threshold Setting:** The current threshold of 0.0700518, based on the distribution of predictions, results in improved balance between precision and recall but still requires fine-tuning for better performance.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Threshold Adjustment:** Fine-tune the classification threshold to achieve a better balance between precision and recall. The newly identified threshold of 0.0700518 improves the balance but needs continuous monitoring and adjustment as more data becomes available.
2. **Data Balancing:** Implement techniques such as SMOTE to handle imbalanced data, ensuring the model captures more positive samples.
3. **Model Retraining:** Periodically retrain the model with updated data to adapt to changing patterns and maintain performance.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional features or transformations that might improve model performance.
5. **Regular Monitoring:** Establish a routine for monitoring model performance metrics over time to detect and address any deterioration in model quality.
6. **Operational Efficiency:** Address identified bottlenecks in loan processing and funding times to enhance overall efficiency.
7. **Risk Assessment for Specific Loan Purposes:** Implement more stringent evaluation criteria for loan purposes with higher default rates to mitigate risk.

### 7. Clarifications and Actions

During the recent meeting with the model development team, it was clarified that the development AUC was calculated on a funded + unfunded population, while the OGM AUC was based only on the funded population. This discrepancy in the population basis led to an apples-to-oranges comparison. As a result, the team agreed on the necessity of a recalibration plan to incorporate both funded and unfunded performance metrics in future OGM reports. The developer is tasked with proposing a new OGM plan to address this issue.

### 8. Conclusion

The loan default prediction model demonstrates moderate performance metrics, particularly in terms of accuracy and specificity. However, there is room for improvement in precision and recall, especially given the imbalanced dataset. By identifying a better classification threshold and implementing data balancing techniques, the model's performance can be further enhanced. Continuous monitoring, retraining, and fine-tuning are essential to ensure sustained performance. Additionally, a recalibration plan to include both funded and unfunded performance metrics is essential for accurate model evaluation.
