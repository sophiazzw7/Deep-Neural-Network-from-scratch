**Meeting Notes: Discussion on Archer Issue FND1734827**

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Attendees:** Sophia, Alex, Jane, Rashmi, Simon (via email), Rami, Andre

### **Key Discussion Points:**
1. **Background on Issue FND1734827**
   - Simon from TAS emailed regarding the remaining issue, stating that backtesting results for IF, DPA, EDPM, and EPWS are still relevant.
   - Model developers, however, indicate that backtesting is no longer applicable.

2. **Clarifications on Model Scope and Impact**
   - Jane sought confirmation on whether other models are related to this issue.
   - Rashmi confirmed that this issue pertains only to one model.
   - The discussion centered on whether Simon's concerns stem from external fraud and CPBP or other segments.
   - Rashmi explained that Simon's concerns likely arise from changes to external fraud and CPBP while backtesting was initially performed on all six event types. However, the other four event types were always qualitative, making backtesting irrelevant.
   - The current methodology is entirely qualitative, meaning backtesting is not appropriate or meaningful.

3. **Next Steps: Communication with Simon**
   - Jane proposed drafting an email to reiterate the message that backtesting is no longer relevant and to clarify the changes.
   - If Simon remains unconvinced, further discussions will be needed.

4. **Potential Model Retirement and Replacement**
   - Jane suggested an option to retire the model and implement a Model Change Approval (MCA) for a new qualitative methodology.
   - Alex agreed that the cleanest approach is to retire and replace the model but raised concerns about execution time constraints.
   - Given the regulatory meeting this week, the urgency of closing the issue was emphasized.
   - Alex indicated that Jane and Rashmi could proceed with documentation for a new model, but the transition would take time.

5. **Pending MRO Review & Regulatory Considerations**
   - Simon is still awaiting MRO responses, which may influence his opinion on the issue.
   - Jane suggested using email correspondence as a formal record of agreements to help move the issue toward resolution.
   - If Simon remains resistant, a follow-up call may be necessary to clarify concerns and expedite closure.

6. **Review Timeline**
   - If Simon continues to consider backtesting applicable, the team will review updated documentation either this week or the following week.
   - The goal is to ensure the interpretation and results are appropriately documented.

7. **Action Items:**
   - **Jane** to draft an email clarifying why backtesting is no longer applicable and copy all attendees.
   - **Team** to await Simon's response and be prepared for a follow-up call if necessary.
   - **Rashmi & Jane** to evaluate feasibility and timing for retiring the model and submitting MCA documentation.
   - **Sophia & Team** to review updated documentation as needed.

### **Conclusion**
- The priority is to communicate clearly with Simon regarding the irrelevance of backtesting given the model's qualitative nature.
- If necessary, a meeting will be scheduled to address remaining concerns.
- The regulatory timeline adds urgency to resolving the issue efficiently.

**Meeting Adjourned.**

**Meeting Notes: Discussion on Negative Net Loss Observations**

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Attendees:** Sophia, Rashmi, Jane

### **Key Discussion Points:**

1. **Observation of Negative Net Loss in Event Data**
   - Sophia inquired about negative net loss observed in `event_w_exclusion` and `event_w_exclusion_dedup`, asking Rashmi to confirm if these were data anomalies.
   - Rashmi clarified that these are not anomalies but represent actual historical financial events over the past nine quarters.
   - The negative net losses reflect the inclusion of recovery mechanisms and do not indicate an issue with data integrity.
   - Rashmi emphasized that removing these gains might misrepresent the actual loss experienced by the bank.
   - The team agreed that further investigation is needed to determine whether these negative net losses should be included in the model.

2. **Impact on Risk Categorization**
   - Sophia highlighted the need for a solid confirmation that these represent legitimate gains and are not data anomalies.
   - The confirmation will impact the categorization of this risk item.
   - Sophia proposed obtaining an email confirmation and sign-off for documentation purposes to ensure clarity in governance reviews.

3. **Addressing Documentation Gaps**
   - Rashmi acknowledged that there was no prior discussion on this in the previous Model Development Document (MDD).
   - The goal is to address this documentation gap and properly document the rationale for including or excluding these gains.
   - Rashmi reiterated that this is part of due diligence and that the exercise is focused on documentation rather than the immediate removal of gains.

4. **Planned Next Steps**
   - Rashmi will conduct further testing and document findings regarding negative net losses.
   - Sophia will follow up on obtaining email confirmation and sign-off to support documentation and governance review.
   - Rashmi will finalize responses on outstanding issues and provide an update by [insert date].

5. **Clarification on Model Code Versions**
   - Sophia sought clarification on whether the provided code snippet represents the production version or the most recent CCAR cycle version.
   - Rashmi explained that the code is a combination of both, but the production version still contains elements that need to be cleaned up.
   - The primary difference between the pre-qualitative change version and the current version is the removal of the model component and the inclusion of EF and CPBP outputs.
   - No major logic changes were made aside from output modifications.
   - Sophia confirmed that the only adjustments involved accommodating EF and CPBP in the outputs while removing the modeling component.

### **Action Items:**
   - **Rashmi** to further investigate the appropriateness of including negative net loss data in the model.
   - **Sophia** to seek email confirmation and sign-off to validate the legitimacy of gains and ensure alignment with governance requirements.
   - **Rashmi** to finalize documentation updates and submit findings by [insert date].
   
### **Conclusion**
- The discussion aimed to clarify the nature of negative net losses and their role in the modeling process.
- Further testing and documentation updates will ensure the issue is properly addressed and well-documented for governance review.
