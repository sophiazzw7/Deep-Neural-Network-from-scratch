Not applicable for an origination underwriting model. There is no classical calibration-based backtest comparing predicted vs. actual default rates for all applicants (including rejects). AUC/KS serve as discrimination metrics, not full backtesting. Instead, AUC and KS are used as ongoing performance (discrimination) metrics to measure how well the model is separating “bads” from “goods” in the production environment.
