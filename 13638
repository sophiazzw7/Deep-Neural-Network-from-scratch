## **Model Description**

The **CCAR/DFAST Operational Loss Forecast Model** estimates potential operational risk losses for Truist under various macroeconomic scenarios, supporting annual **CCAR** and **DFAST** stress tests and capital planning. The model is part of the **PPNR suite** and uses a **frequency-times-severity** framework: each Basel-defined event type’s **expected frequency** is multiplied by its **expected severity** to produce quarterly loss estimates. Additional **stress deltas** are then added to management’s baseline forecast to create severe-but-plausible CCAR projections.

1. **Scope & Purpose**  
   - **Scope**: Six Basel event types are included—**IF**, **EF**, **CPBP**, **EDPM**, **DPA**, **EPWS**—while **BDSF** is excluded.  
   - **Purpose**: Provide **credible, institution-specific** operational loss forecasts under adverse conditions, aligning with Federal Reserve requirements. Model results feed into the **FR Y-14A** reporting form and receive challenge from the **Capital Committee** and **Operational Risk Management** SMEs.

2. **Methodology**  
   - **Frequency**:  
     - Historically, **EF** and **CPBP** used **negative binomial regression** to capture potential macroeconomic drivers; other event types relied on a **simple 9Q average** or negative binomial if strong macro correlations were discovered.  
     - Due to weak macroeconomic relationships, **EF** and **CPBP** now also rely on the **qualitative 9Q average** approach, mirroring the other four event types.  
   - **Severity**:  
     - **Severity is largely random**, showing minimal correlation with macroeconomic factors.  
     - The model applies **historical average severity** plus **stress multipliers** (derived from identified stress periods) to differentiate stressed vs. non-stressed conditions.

3. **Governance & Use**  
   - **Reviewed by SMEs** in Operational Risk Management and subject to challenge by the **Capital Committee**.  
   - **Mapped to FR Y-14A** and other regulatory submissions for CCAR/DFAST.  
   - **Tier 2 Model** (per Model Risk Oversight) and cannot be extended beyond CCAR/DFAST without additional validation.

By centralizing on **internally observed data** (Archer for ≥\$10K gross losses, plus limited exploration of small GL losses), the model provides a coherent approach to capture **severe but plausible** operational risk losses, ensuring **relevance** to Truist’s evolving risk landscape.
