### **1.2.7 OGM Reporting**  

The **OGM reporting process** for MOD13627 ZORS Adverse Action Model follows a structured and standardized framework to assess model performance, track stability metrics, and ensure compliance with **Model Risk Oversight (MRO) requirements**. The reporting cadence, submission requirements, and stakeholder review process are clearly defined to maintain transparency and consistency in ongoing monitoring.  

---

### **1.2.7.1 OGM Report Structure**  

Each **OGM report** includes the following key components:  

1. **Performance Metrics Results**  
   - **Population Stability Index (PSI) for Reference Attributes**  
   - **Risk Score Stability**  
   - **High-Frequency Decline Reasons Stability**  
   - **Explanation Coverage for Top 5 Key Factors**  

2. **Threshold Compliance Assessment**  
   - Performance results are categorized into **Green, Yellow, or Red** based on predefined stability thresholds.  
   - The rating system ensures that **metrics outside the acceptable range** are flagged for further investigation.  
   - **Escalation procedures** are triggered if a metric remains in a breach status.  

3. **Comparison to Previous Periods**  
   - The OGM report **monitors trends across multiple reporting cycles** to detect changes in model performance.  
   - **Performance shifts are analyzed and documented** to determine if corrective actions are necessary.  

4. **Escalation Status**  
   - If an **outer threshold breach** is detected, the **OGM action plan is triggered** (as outlined in Section 9.1.6).  
   - Escalation actions include **root cause analysis, recalibration, or redevelopment**, depending on the severity of the issue.

### **1.2.7.2 OGM Data Sources & Controls**  

The **OGM report relies on validated and structured data sources** to ensure consistency, traceability, and accuracy.  

- **Data Sources**:  
  - Model inputs and scoring logs from **LightStream ZestAI Adverse Action Model**.  
  - Production data stored in **AWS, network shares, and the LightStream data warehouse**.  
  - Loan application data retrieved through **secure SFTP processes**.  

- **Data Quality Controls**:  
  - Production logs are reviewed to **verify data consistency**.  
  - OGM outputs undergo **metric verification** before submission.  
  - **Cross-validation with prior OGM reports** ensures continuity and identifies any anomalies.  

A structured **data lineage process** ensures that all **Critical Data Elements (CDEs)** remain stable across reporting cycles.

### **1.2.7.3 OGM Report Submission Schedule**  

OGM reports for MOD13627 are submitted **biannually** according to the following schedule:  

| **Reporting Period** | **Submission Due Date** |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Q2 OGM Report      | **August 31**         |
| Q4 OGM Report      | **February 28/29**    |

- The **submission deadline is 60 days after the end of each quarter** to allow for data collection, validation, and report preparation.  
- Reports must use **the most recent data available** to provide an accurate reflection of model performance.  

---

### **1.2.7.4 Stakeholder Review & Sign-Off**  

- All **OGM reports are reviewed by the model owner** before submission.  
- Model users have **two business days** to provide feedback before the report is finalized.  
- Final reports are submitted to **Model Risk Oversight (MRO)** for compliance review and governance validation.  
- The **LightStream Zest Steering Committee** is responsible for reviewing escalated OGM results and determining any further corrective actions.  

---

### **Final Assessment**  

- âœ… **OGM reporting follows a structured framework with defined performance metrics, thresholds, and escalation triggers.**  
- âœ… **Data sources and validation processes ensure consistency and accuracy.**  
- âœ… **Stakeholder review and escalation procedures are in place to address any deviations from expected performance.**  
- âœ… **Submission deadlines align with regulatory expectations and governance standards.**  

This OGM reporting process ensures **effective ongoing monitoring, timely issue resolution, and structured communication** to maintain the integrity of MOD13627.
