# **OGM Plan Review Report for MOD13627 ZORS Adverse Action Model**  
**Version: 1.0.20241130**  
**Model Owner: Vera Zhang**  
**Review Conducted by: [Your Name]**  
**Date: [Date of Report]**

## **1. OGM Plan Assessment**  

### **1.2.1 OGM Plan Granularity**  
The OGM plan for MOD13627 is sufficiently granular and aligns with the model’s design. It ensures appropriate tracking of the model’s performance across defined segments and key performance indicators.

### **1.2.2 Performance Tests and Monitoring Frequency**  
The model performance tests in the OGM plan are adequate for assessing model performance and are consistent with business objectives. OGM reporting is conducted **biannually**, which is appropriate for a **Tier 2** model as specified in the **MRM policy**.  

### **1.2.3 Performance Metrics and Thresholds**  
The performance metrics and thresholds used for monitoring MOD13627 include:  

- **Population Stability Index (PSI):** Used to track **feature stability** and **risk score stability**, with thresholds of **0.1 and 0.25**.  
- **Concordance Index:** Stability threshold for **high-frequency decline reasons** set at **5 and 7**.  
- **Explanation Coverage:** Percentage of explanation coverage for top **5 key factors**, with thresholds of **0.5 and 0.6**.  

All performance thresholds align with established best practices and industry standards.

### **1.2.4 OGM Starting Date**  
The **first OGM report** for MOD13627 was submitted on **August 31, 2023**. Sufficient internal data was collected to allow for performance assessment since model implementation.

### **1.2.5 Model Use Limitation**  
There are **no identified application boundaries or model use limitations** for MOD13627.

### **1.2.6 Escalation Plan**  
The escalation plan for MOD13627 specifies distinct escalation actions based on model performance breaches:

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Triggered if a metric breach occurs for **two consecutive OGM reports**, requiring a **remediation plan** within **90 days**.  
- **Model Recalibration:** If a **first-time breach** occurs, the model owner and developer will determine whether recalibration is needed.  
- **Model Redevelopment:** If breaches persist over multiple reporting cycles, a **model redevelopment process** is initiated.  

Escalation actions are clearly specified and align with the governance structure.

### **1.2.7 OGM Reporting**  
The OGM reporting structure includes:

1. **Reporting Structure:** Defined **roles and responsibilities** for data collection, analysis, and report submission.  
2. **Data Controls:** Verification processes to ensure **accuracy and completeness** of OGM data.  
3. **Monitoring Process:** Model developers review logs for potential issues.  
4. **Escalation and Communication:** OGM results are communicated through **Steering Committee Meetings** and other governance structures.  
5. **OGM Rating Calculation:** Model performance is classified as **Green, Yellow, or Red** based on adherence to established thresholds.

## **3. Validation Review Conclusion**  
After reviewing the MOD13627 OGM Plan, **MRO** has determined that:

- **Updates made to the model development documentation** were reasonable and well-documented.  
- The **OGM reporting structure and communication processes** are appropriate.  
- **Model thresholds, escalation plans, and monitoring elements** are aligned with industry best practices.  

The following risk prevention (RP) items owned by the model development team were successfully completed:

- **MD RP-16352286 / FND-12620126**  

The change request **MCH0002900** has been **approved and closed**.  
As a result of validation, **MOD13627 is rated "Fit for Use."**
