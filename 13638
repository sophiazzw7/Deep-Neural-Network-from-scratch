MRO concludes that while the developer’s data usage appears adequate for the revised EF and CPBP approach, additional scrutiny is needed to confirm the appropriateness of negative net losses. The assumptions underlying data selection—particularly the recent 9Q horizon—remain acceptable given the high volatility and idiosyncratic nature of operational risk losses. However, MRO has raised a risk item requesting more detailed analysis of these data points to ensure they accurately reflect the model’s intended scope and are free from any systematic errors.
