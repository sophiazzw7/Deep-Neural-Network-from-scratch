Based on your provided SAS code, here's an analysis and corresponding draft for the **Data Quality and Appropriateness** report. This includes sections based on what your code is performing and aligns with the expectations outlined in the document.

## Data Quality and Appropriateness Report

### 1. **Data Quality Assessment**

#### 1.1 Data Sources
- The datasets `archer_data` (imported from `archer_report_&output_date..xlsx`) and `exclusion_ie` (imported from `Exclusion_IE.csv`) are used as primary inputs. These datasets are sourced from structured files, indicating reliability.

#### 1.2 Distribution Analysis
- **Continuous Variables**: The variable `net_loss` is calculated in `archer_prep` as a combination of `Gross Loss Amount` and `Recovery Amount`. Statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation can be used for further analysis.
- **Categorical Variables**: Variables such as `'Basel Event Type Level 1'` and `'Internal Events'` are utilized, and their frequency distributions are processed using SQL procedures.

#### 1.3 Outlier Detection
- The dataset `archer_prep` is analyzed, and minimum posting dates (`min_date`) are identified for grouping. Potential outliers in `net_loss` or other numeric fields could be flagged using statistical thresholds (e.g., 1.5×IQR).

#### 1.4 Missing and Duplicate Values
- Duplicates are removed during data preparation (`proc sort nodupkey`). However, explicit missing value treatment is not observed in the provided code.

### 2. **Data Appropriateness Assessment**

#### 2.1 Data Cleaning and Transformation
- The code includes steps to aggregate and transform data:
  - Variables like `year_event`, `month_event`, `qtr_event`, and `posting_mmyy` are derived from posting dates.
  - Macroeconomic variables (`Fin_Act_Employment`, `Consumer_Credit`, `DOWJ_Total`, etc.) are lagged or log-transformed for subsequent modeling.

#### 2.2 Data Weighting, Partitioning, and Relevance
- Variables are prepared in stages:
  - `event_w_exclusion` and `event_w_exclusion_dedup` exclude irrelevant records based on specific rules (e.g., `Event Record Type` not in certain categories).
  - Relevant data points are aggregated in `event_w_exclusion_agg` for analysis by event type and severity.

#### 2.3 Outlier Treatment
- While explicit outlier treatment isn't fully implemented, transformations (e.g., lagged variables) and exclusions of specific event types are used to maintain data quality.

#### 2.4 Missing Data Treatment
- The provided code doesn't explicitly handle missing data. However, the datasets `archer_data` and `event_w_exclusion` assume completeness post-import.

#### 2.5 Statistical Validation
- Statistical modeling steps (e.g., `PROC GENMOD`) validate the appropriateness of transformed variables:
  - For `cpbp_model_data`, the frequency component is modeled using `SP500_Vol_MAVG_Ydiff` and `GDP_Real_Lag2` with a negative binomial distribution.
  - For `ef_model_data`, variables like `Fin_Act_Employment_qoq`, `Consumer_Credit_lag1`, and `DOWJ_Total_qoq` are used.

### Recommendations:
1. **Outlier Handling**:
   - Implement explicit outlier detection and treatment (e.g., using thresholds or IQR-based rules) for key numeric variables like `net_loss`.
   
2. **Missing Data**:
   - Assess missing data in primary datasets and apply backfilling or removal as appropriate.

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Perform additional checks on consistency across aggregated fields (e.g., `year_event`, `month_event`) and assess their alignment with input data.

4. **Appropriateness Testing**:
   - Validate data transformations and exclusions against predefined model objectives to ensure no relevant information is lost.

This draft is directly informed by your SAS code. Let me know if you’d like further refinement or if you want me to highlight specific sections of your code in the report!



Let me identify the datasets used in your provided SAS code and customize the earlier script accordingly. Here's the breakdown of the datasets identified from your images:

### Datasets Used:
1. **`archer_data`**: Imported from `archer_report_&output_date..xlsx`.
2. **`exclusion_ie`**: Imported from `Exclusion_IE.csv`.
3. **`archer_prep` and its variations (`archer_prep_1`, `archer_prep_2`)**: Derived from `archer_data`.
4. **`event_w_exclusion`, `event_w_exclusion_dedup`, `event_w_exclusion_agg`**: Created through exclusions and aggregations.
5. **`mev_data`**: Contains macroeconomic data from `mac_dat.macrovar_qrt_bl`.
6. **`cpbp_model_data`** and **`ef_model_data`**: Derived from `mev_data` and historical datasets (`cpbp_hist`, `ef_hist`).

### Customized Code:
Below is the modified SAS script tailored to the datasets and logic from your provided code:

```sas
/* 1. Import Archer Data */
proc import datafile="&input_path/archer_report_&output_date..xlsx" 
    out=work.archer_data 
    dbms=xlsx 
    replace;
    sheet="sas_input";
    getnames=yes;
run;

/* 2. Import Exclusion Data */
proc import datafile="&static_path/Exclusion_IE.csv" 
    out=work.exclusion_ie 
    dbms=csv 
    replace;
    getnames=yes;
run;

/* 3. Analyze Distribution of Archer Data */
/* Continuous Variables */
proc means data=work.archer_data mean median std p25 p50 p75;
    var net_loss; /* Adjust based on relevant numeric variables */
run;

/* Categorical Variables */
proc freq data=work.archer_data;
    tables 'Basel Event Type Level 1'n 'Internal Events'n; /* Replace with relevant categorical columns */
run;

/* 4. Detect Outliers in Archer Data */
data work.outliers;
    set work.archer_data;
    /* Example: Detect outliers in net_loss */
    if net_loss < (mean(net_loss) - 1.5*std(net_loss)) or 
       net_loss > (mean(net_loss) + 1.5*std(net_loss)) then
        outlier_flag = 1;
    else outlier_flag = 0;
run;

proc freq data=work.outliers;
    tables outlier_flag;
run;

/* 5. Check Missing and Duplicated Values */
/* Missing Values */
proc means data=work.archer_data nmiss;
    var _numeric_;
run;

proc freq data=work.archer_data;
    tables _character_ / missing;
run;

/* Duplicates */
proc sort data=work.archer_data nodupkey out=work.archer_data_nodups;
    by _all_;
run;

/* 6. Consistency Checks */
/* Example: Basel Event Type should not contain invalid values */
data work.consistency_check;
    set work.archer_data;
    if 'Basel Event Type Level 1'n = "" then consistency_flag = "Missing Basel Event";
    else if net_loss < 0 then consistency_flag = "Negative Loss";
    else consistency_flag = "OK";
run;

proc freq data=work.consistency_check;
    tables consistency_flag;
run;

/* 7. Visualize Data Distribution */
ods graphics on;
proc univariate data=work.archer_data;
    var net_loss; /* Adjust based on relevant continuous variables */
    histogram / normal;
run;
ods graphics off;
```

### Adjustments Made:
1. Focused on **`archer_data`** as the primary dataset for the analysis.
2. Included columns like `net_loss`, `'Basel Event Type Level 1'n`, and `'Internal Events'n` for analysis, derived from your original code.
3. Added placeholders for missing/duplicate checks and adjusted rules for consistency checks (e.g., negative values, missing fields).
4. Tailored outlier detection for `net_loss`.

Let me know if you'd like further refinements or additional customizations for other datasets like `mev_data` or `cpbp_model_data`.
