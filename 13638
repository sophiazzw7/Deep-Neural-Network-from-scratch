**Subject:** Update on FND-17134827 Closure and Validation Timeline  

Dear Alex,  

I wanted to provide an update on finding FND-17134827 and share concerns regarding the timeline for its closure and the associated validation.  

We received materials from Rashmi on December 11 and began our review. While we successfully closed the following parts of the finding:  

- [List of closed parts]  

The following parts remain unresolved due to insufficient information:  

- [List of parts not closed]  

We shared a detailed question list with Rashmi on December 13, which also included broader validation questions. However, today I noticed her Teams status indicates she will be out of office until February 1, 2025. This raises concerns about addressing the remaining questions and completing the validation in a timely manner.  

To assist, I’ve attached a more focused document outlining both our concerns toward the remaining parts of FND-17134827 and a clearer breakdown of unresolved items for the validation.  

Could you please advise on how we should proceed, especially considering the potential delays caused by Rashmi’s absence? I’m happy to draft a communication plan or take further steps as needed.  

Thank you for your guidance.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
