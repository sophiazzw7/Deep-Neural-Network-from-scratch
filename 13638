MODEL DESCRIPTION

The CCAR/DFAST Operational Loss Forecast Model at Truist is part of the broader PPNR suite supporting stress testing and capital planning. It provides quarterly loss estimates for six Basel-defined operational risk event types: IF, EF, CPBP, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS (BDSF is excluded). Key outputs are incorporated into the FR Y-14A submission and reviewed by Operational Risk Management SMEs and the Capital Committee.

The model follows a frequency-times-severity approach:

• Frequency. Before the methodology change, EF and CPBP used negative binomial regression if macroeconomic predictors appeared relevant. If no significant macro linkages were found, or for the other event types (IF, EDPM, DPA, EPWS), the model applied a nine-quarter rolling average of historical events.  
• Severity. All event types relied on historical average severities. Stress vs. baseline conditions were reflected using multipliers drawn from historical peaks or stress periods. These multipliers were periodically refreshed based on updated experience.

By focusing on internal Archer data (≥$10,000 net loss) and applying additional overlays or multipliers where needed, the model aims to capture both baseline expectations and plausible stress outcomes for the bank’s operational losses.

MODEL CHANGES

1. Removal of Negative Binomial for EF and CPBP.  
Originally, EF and CPBP were modeled via negative binomial regression to capture possible macroeconomic influences on event frequency. In practice, these models produced weak or inconsistent relationships, necessitating frequent manual overlays. Under the updated methodology, EF and CPBP now align with the other event types’ qualitative approach, using a simple nine-quarter historical average for frequency.

2. Adoption of a Uniform Multiplier-Based Method.  
EF and CPBP stress forecasts are determined by multiplying the nine-quarter average frequency and severity by a stress factor (for example, 3.5). Other event types (IF, EDPM, DPA, EPWS) also rely on historical averages but may apply specific multipliers for baseline and stress scenarios, often derived from a longer “development” window of data and identified stress periods.

3. Streamlined Forecasting and Reduced Overlays.  
By discontinuing macroeconomic variables for EF and CPBP and unifying all event types under a single multiplier-based framework, the need for large manual overlays has decreased significantly. The updated approach places greater emphasis on internal operational data and expert judgment, resulting in forecasts that better reflect Truist’s current risk environment and structural controls.
