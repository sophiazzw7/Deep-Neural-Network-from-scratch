Below is a **sample OGM Plan Element Applicability Review Table**, following a **template** approach. In it, we enumerate each standard monitoring element, specify whether it is included in the OGM plan, map it to the **metrics** (e.g., Metric 1, 2, 3, 4) where relevant, and provide a brief **assessment**—even for elements that are included.

You’ll notice that **backtesting** is marked as “No” because this is a **loan origination** model (underwriting), so there is no traditional “predictive vs. realized” window in the sense used by, for example, forecasting or account management models.

### **OGM Plan Element Applicability Review**

| **Ref No.** | **Monitoring Element**          | **Included in OGM Plan?** | **Metric(s) or Section**         | **MRO Assessment**                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | **Limitations & Assumptions**   | **Yes**                   | Addressed qualitatively. Supported by overall model discrimination & stability metrics (Metrics 1, 2, 3, 4). | Model developers list known limitations in Section 9.1.4 and track them using discrimination (AUC/KS) and PSI. Coverage is sufficient. |
| 2           | **Backtesting**                 | **No**                    | **N/A**                           | Not applicable for an origination underwriting model. There is no “backtest” of reason codes or ex-post forecast as in portfolio models. |
| 3           | **Benchmarking Analysis**        | **Yes** (feasible cases)  | Section 9.1.1.6 & 9.1.1.8         | A comparison to PLRS (MOD11827) or LIDS (MOD11709) may be conducted, though data censoring can complicate results. |
| 4           | **Boundary Conditions**          | **No**                    | **N/A**                           | As stated in Section 9.1.4, XGBoost handles outliers automatically. No boundary constraints or conditions needed. |
| 5           | **Early Warning Indicators**     | **Yes**                   | Standard metrics (1, 2, 3, 4) used at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (with adjusted thresholds). | Plan aligns with Tier 1 approach. Early warning is phased out after 18 months when standard OGM begins. |
| 6           | **Model Input Monitoring**       | **Yes**                   | **Metric 3** (Feature PSI) and **Metric 4** (ZORS PSI). | PSI values are calculated each OGM cycle to monitor drift in both features and scores. |
| 7           | **Overlay / Override Tracking**  | **No**                    | **N/A**                           | The model does not allow user overrides or overlays, so no tracking is required. |
| 8           | **Scenario / Stress Analysis**   | **No**                    | **N/A**                           | Model does not incorporate scenario inputs; no scenario-based metrics. |
| 9           | **Sensitivity Analysis**         | **Yes** (informational)   | **Section 9.1.1.9** (ZORS ±5%, ±10%, ±15%, ±20% shift). | The plan includes hypothetical shifts and PSI calculations for distribution changes. Developer may seek to remove, but it currently exists as an optional test. |

### **About the Metrics**

- **Metric 1**: **AUC / Somers’ D** (Discrimination)  
- **Metric 2**: **K-S Statistic** (Discrimination)  
- **Metric 3**: **Feature PSI** (Stability)  
- **Metric 4**: **ZORS Score PSI** (Stability)  

*(Note: Some organizations will number them differently, but this table reflects a notional numbering scheme aligning with “discrimination = Metrics 1 & 2, stability = Metrics 3 & 4.”)*

#### **Backtesting Metric?**
As indicated above (Row 2), **no backtesting metric** is included because **MOD13512** is an **origination** decision model rather than a **portfolio performance** forecasting model. Typically, “backtesting” involves comparing predicted values to actual observed outcomes over a historical “hold-out” period. In underwriting decisions—especially when rejected applications do not yield “real” performance outcomes (except via reject inference)—a standard backtest metric does not apply in the same way. The model’s performance is instead monitored through **AUC, K-S, and PSI** on funded loans (and inferred outcomes for rejects) rather than a backtest per se.

This table structure satisfies the **OGM plan element applicability** requirement by clearly stating:

- **Whether an element is included**  
- **Which metric or section** addresses it  
- **An assessment** explaining *why* it is or is not in scope, including justification for exclusions.
