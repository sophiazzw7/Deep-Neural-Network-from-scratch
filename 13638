## Meeting Title
**MOD13638 Discussion**

## Participants
- Rashmi  
- Sophia  
- Jane  
- Kuldeep  
- (Mentions of Alex, Rami, and others occur but they did not provide extensive input in the transcript)

## Discussion Points

1. **Metric 2 (Stability Testing) & Potential Additional Metric**  
   - Rashmi explained Metric 2 focuses on p-values for re-estimated coefficients to assess predictive power.  
   - Sophia mentioned a suggestion from MRO to track the *magnitude* of the coefficients (e.g., if they double).  
   - Rashmi clarified that they already watch for large coefficient changes, but no formal threshold exists yet.  

2. **New OGM Plan in Annual Review**  
   - Sophia stated the new OGM Plan is part of the annual review (RP2).  
   - Rashmi noted initial confusion, as they had not been told the new OGM was part of the annual review.  
   - Jane said the intention is for the model to have a compliant OGM plan while also satisfying annual review requirements.

3. **Suggestion to Add a Magnitude-Based Metric**  
   - Jane viewed it as a *good suggestion* but not a requirement to meet compliance.  
   - Rashmi agreed that adding a metric with a specific threshold would require more time for testing.  
   - It was stated they could include this as part of the new OGM or as a future improvement.

4. **Archer Finding 126202126**  
   - Sophia indicated this finding and the annual review are on the same timeline.  
   - Discussion noted that the Archer finding involves testing and possible concerns about model stability.  
   - Jane said some points might remain open if further analysis is needed.  
   - The governance team may categorize any concerns as an issue, sub-issue, or suggestion.

5. **Concern About Model Stability**  
   - Kuldeep pointed out discrepancies (over-prediction, differences from development estimates) in certain segments (e.g., CTEP, EF).  
   - Rashmi acknowledged data shifts and said actions are taken depending on whether changes are permanent or transitory.  
   - Jane and Rashmi reiterated that implementing a new stability metric would require extensive work.

6. **Code Changes & Backtesting**  
   - Sophia mentioned noticing code changes in certain folders and asked who made them and why.  
   - Kuldeep tried replicating Metric 3 values using the available code and saw a mismatch with OGM report aggregates.  
   - Rashmi noted older OGM plans only showed aggregate values. The new OGM plan will break down baseline vs. severely adverse values per segment.  

7. **Annual Review Timeline & Next Steps**  
   - The annual review ends on February 7.  
   - Rashmi and Sophia will coordinate with Jane and possibly Alex on providing responses to question lists and Archer findings.  
   - Rashmi will check the code changes and send clarifications.  
   - Rashmi will share how Metric 3 is calculated; Sophia will share their Excel approach to isolate any discrepancies.

## Action Items (Exact Wording from the Conversation)

1. **Written Response & Documentation**  
   - Rashmi will write up how they track coefficient changes and include it as part of the response.  
   - The plan is to document concerns about model stability and potential data shifts in the limitations section.  

2. **Exchange Calculation Details**  
   - Sophia will share the Excel sheet with Rashmi.  
   - Rashmi will provide the breakdown on how the team arrived at certain Metric 3 values.  

3. **Follow-Up with Governance Team**  
   - The group will decide if the suggested stability metric becomes an issue, sub-issue, or suggestion.  
   - Whether or not it can be included in the OGM plan depends on the timeline and the governance teamâ€™s direction.

4. **Address Archer Finding**  
   - The team will handle Archer Finding 126202126 in the annual review.  
   - Any unresolved points will be documented by the February 7 deadline.

5. **Clarify Code Changes**  
   - Rashmi will investigate who made the code updates in the folder and confirm if they were routine or unplanned.

6. **Coordinate Timelines**  
   - A separate discussion with Alex will confirm final timelines for providing question-list answers and Archer Finding updates.
