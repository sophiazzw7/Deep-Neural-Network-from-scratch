### **Proposed Risk Items for Model Documentation and Implementation**

1. **Documentation Gaps & Outdated Content**  
   - Missing **Model Risk Tier Table**; MCA form requires an update.  
   - Outdated assumptions, limitations, and methodology references in **Sections 1.2, 1.5, 3, and 4.3** need revision.  
   - Remove obsolete **variable selection process** for EF and CPBP.  
   - Clarify methodology for IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS, particularly **multiplier derivation and stress period determination**.

2. **Data Integrity Issues**  
   - **GL data references** should be removed if not used.  
   - **Negative severity values** (e.g., -57,583.81 in IF) require investigation.  
   - Validate **negative loss values in Event_w_exclusion and Event_w_exclusion_dedup**; enhance data controls.  
   - **Data quality testing framework** is missing and should be established.

3. **Implementation Delays**  
   - **Production code is not finalized**; implementation sub-issue required.  
   - **Sections 7 (Model Implementation) & 8 (Model Use Controls)** need revision post-implementation.

4. **Regulatory & Policy Compliance**  
   - Update **policy and procedure references** to reflect qualitative methodology.  
   - Clearly define **model exposure (portfolio size, risk types impacted)**.  
   - Include a **Business Continuity & Contingency Plan**.

5. **Performance Monitoring & OGM Plan Removal**  
   - Remove the **OGM plan**; instead, **EF/CPBP multipliers and recent 9Q data** will be reassessed annually.  
   - Annual **stress period review** for IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS; improve **data controls**.

6. **Stakeholder Review & Template Alignment**  
   - Confirm and update **model stakeholders**.  
   - Align documentation with the **latest MDD template standards**.

This version retains all key issues while being more concise and structured. Let me know if you need further refinements.
