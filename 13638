**Revised Model Methodology IVR Report Section**  
Below is an expanded section focusing on how the developers selected the 3.5 multiplier for EF and CPBP, as well as an assessment of assumptions and limitations for EF/CPBP and a high-level review of the other four segments (DPA, EPWS, IF, EDPM). The discussion also addresses the annual stress period selection process and multiplier updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Reasonableness of Model Approach, Method, and Logic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Operational Loss Forecasting Model projects quarterly frequency and severity of loss events under baseline and stressed conditions. Previously, External Fraud (EF) and Clients, Products & Business Practices (CPBP) employed negative binomial regression to incorporate macroeconomic factors. However, due to weak correlations between macro variables and these operational loss types—along with frequent “overlays” and manual adjustments—the developers transitioned EF and CPBP to a simpler, qualitative framework. This revised method uses:

- A rolling average of the past nine quarters (9Q) to represent baseline frequency, and  
- A stress multiplier (around 3.0 to 3.5) to escalate frequency or severity under adverse scenarios.

For the other four event types—Damage to Physical Assets (DPA), Employment Practices & Workplace Safety (EPWS), Internal Fraud (IF), and Execution, Delivery & Process Management (EDPM)—the existing frameworks remain in place. These four types may use negative binomial regression if a robust macro relationship is identified or continue using a nine-quarter average if no meaningful correlation is found. Stress multipliers are similarly refreshed annually for these event types, albeit with typically smaller overlay adjustments compared to EF and CPBP.

Given the high idiosyncrasy of operational losses, the qualitative approach for EF and CPBP appears more aligned with actual observed data. It reduces reliance on macroeconomic variables that lacked explanatory power and mitigates the need for frequent, large manual overlays.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Theoretical and Empirical Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Theoretical Basis  
Operational risk events—fraud, litigation, cyber breaches—are typically uncorrelated with standard economic indicators, as validated by industry guidance and regulatory expectations that encourage using qualitative judgment where purely quantitative methods are unreliable.

b. Empirical Evidence  
Prior negative binomial regression outputs for EF and CPBP repeatedly missed actual stress losses, prompting large adjustments (haircuts, multipliers) to reconcile forecasts with real outcomes. Developer analysis (comparing EF and CPBP losses to Dow Jones or GDP) showed inconsistent or weak links. Hence, using a nine-quarter rolling average plus a stress multiplier is empirically defensible: it relies on recent actual data and recognized operational risk patterns rather than uncertain macro inputs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Multiplier Selection and the Rationale Behind 3.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developers considered multiple methodologies for deriving a stress multiplier, including 95th-percentile ratios, maximum-to-average comparisons, historical overlay magnitudes, and re-estimated negative binomial outputs. The resulting spectrum of plausible multipliers ranged from approximately 2.24 (a lower bound from prior EF overlays) to over 10 for certain CPBP extremes.

The ultimate choice of 3.5 was not a rigid, purely statistical outcome. Instead, it reflects a blend of:

- Historical overlay trends, where multipliers of 3.0 to 3.5 were frequently used to align model results with real losses.  
- 9Q maximum-to-average ratios in the 3.0–3.86 range.  
- Observed underprediction by the negative binomial model (particularly for EF), which often necessitated doubling or tripling the forecast.  
- Expert judgment from operational risk SMEs, who deemed 3.5 to be a “practical and defensible figure” that fell within the identified multiplier spectrum.

By positioning 3.5 near the higher end of typical historical overlays (but still below extreme upper bounds like 10.55), the model aims to produce stress forecasts that are sufficiently conservative yet grounded in actual past behavior. Should future conditions change substantially, SMEs and developers plan to revisit and update the multiplier as part of the annual monitoring cycle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Assessment of Qualitative Judgment for EF/CPBP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qualitative judgment underpins several key areas of the EF/CPBP approach:

- The reliance on the most recent nine quarters (9Q) to approximate current risk conditions, justified by control environment changes and evolving external threats.  
- Selection of a single stress multiplier (3.0–3.5) instead of relying on detailed, scenario-specific multipliers.  
- The use of historical overlay experience to anchor the multiplier range, rather than a purely statistical method that might not capture institution-specific risk nuances.

Given the volatility and unpredictability of EF and CPBP events, this reliance on structured judgment, historical data, and SME input is both reasonable and consistent with operational risk industry practices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Assumptions and Limitations for EF & CPBP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Assumptions
1. Multiplier Spectrum  
   A single “best” multiplier does not exist; instead, the model developers generate a range of possible multipliers (2.24 up to 10.55) using various established methods. The chosen figure (3.5) is assumed to lie in a robust zone that balances high-level conservatism with historical plausibility.

2. Relevance of the Recent 9Q History  
   The model presumes that the past nine quarters capture the most pertinent risk profile for EF and CPBP going forward. This selection is somewhat subjective, reflecting expert intuition about control changes, threat landscapes, and organizational shifts.

b. Limitations
1. Single Stress Average for Each Event Type  
   The model applies one stress average (severity) per event type, without fine-tuning for different economic or scenario conditions. In reality, distinct stress scenarios might warrant separate multipliers or severity assumptions.

2. Data Coverage and Archer Capture Threshold  
   Archer tracks losses ≥ $10,000, aligning with policy requirements but potentially excluding smaller incidents. Historical coverage also only dates back to 2005, limiting the data available for extreme event analysis.

3. Data Aggregation and Manual Execution  
   The quarterly aggregation code is owned and run by the model developers, with plans to automate in collaboration with the CAMP team. Until fully automated, there is some risk of process or execution inconsistency.

Overall, these assumptions and limitations are clearly acknowledged by the developers. The model team intends to refresh multipliers and revalidate the nine-quarter approach annually to maintain alignment with emerging risk conditions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. High-Level Evaluation of the Other Four Segments (DPA, EPWS, IF, EDPM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For DPA, EPWS, IF, and EDPM, the methodology remains relatively unchanged:

- Where macroeconomic correlations are identified (and validated), negative binomial regression may be used to forecast frequency. If not, the nine-quarter rolling average approach is retained.  
- Stress severity is determined using an annual process that identifies a stress period (often a 9Q window of elevated severity).  
- Multipliers are selected by percentile thresholds (for instance, the 95th percentile) and applied to produce adverse or severely adverse forecasts.

The reasonableness of this method is grounded in the same rationale used for EF and CPBP: operational risk often exhibits high idiosyncrasy, so heavily macro-driven forecasts can be unreliable. By employing a mix of partial quantitative methods (where feasible) and qualitative judgment (annual selection of stress windows, SME involvement), the four segments maintain a consistent framework with EF and CPBP. Each year, the identified stress period is revisited, and multiplier calibration may shift if newer data indicates materially different risk patterns.

From a qualitative standpoint, the approach for DPA, EPWS, IF, and EDPM appears similarly justifiable. The developer’s methodology includes:

- Selecting a stress period by examining continuous elevated severity/frequency intervals, typically through moving-average methods.  
- Applying multipliers for baseline (non-stress) and adverse scenarios, often pegged to a high percentile of the historical distribution.  
- Reviewing these choices annually, with adjustments made only if new data demonstrates a notably different trend or surpasses historical extremes.

This process ensures a level of consistency across all six Basel event types, while still allowing for some customization in the presence (or absence) of meaningful macroeconomic drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Conclusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The transition of EF and CPBP to a nine-quarter baseline with a 3.5 stress multiplier is well-substantiated by multiple methods. This figure falls within a historically derived range (2.24 to over 10), incorporates expert judgment, and resolves prior issues with underperforming negative binomial regressions.  
2. Key assumptions (recent 9Q validity, single stress average) and limitations (data capture threshold, partial manual processes) are documented, with an annual review process designed to mitigate or revise these if conditions change significantly.  
3. The broader approach for DPA, EPWS, IF, and EDPM remains reasonable, employing either negative binomial regression or a rolling average plus stress multiplier. Annual stress period selection and multiplier updates are consistent across all six event types.  
4. Overall, the revised framework for EF and CPBP—combined with the existing methodology for the other four segments—addresses the unique challenges of operational risk, aligns with known industry practices, and is supported by both empirical evidence and expert assessments.  

This model structure thus appears fit for purpose, subject to ongoing monitoring and updates in line with evolving risk profiles and data availability.
