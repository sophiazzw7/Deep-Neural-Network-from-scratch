MRO identified specific negative net losses in the top 200 by absolute severity, led by a −$8.44 million entry (ET7, 31MAR2015) and repeated −$5.73 million entries (ET4, 31DEC2016). These large negatives may represent overshoot recoveries or data anomalies that require additional SME validation.


Among the negatives, the same −$8.44 million EDPM (31MAR2015) and −$5.73 million CPBP (31DEC2016) entries appear, alongside smaller negatives (e.g., −$509k, −$250k).

Deduplication revealed 50 distinct negative net losses, five times more than initially observed in event_w_exclusion, indicating that prior duplication masked the true count of extreme negative losses.
The aggregation process in event_w_exclusion_agg offset most negative losses, leaving only one instance of negative severity, reducing visibility into outlier loss patterns.
MRO recommends further SME review to confirm whether extreme negative losses reflect true business losses or data anomalies.
Additional verification is needed for event_w_exclusion_agg to assess whether extreme losses were appropriately handled or if adjustments are required to prevent the underestimation of risk.
