## 2. OGM Plan Assessment

### 2.1 OGM Plan Granularity

The plan references Sections 9.1.3, 9.3.2, and 9.3.5 to describe how OGM activities are structured and performed. It explains how data input checks, performance reviews, and escalation triggers are applied at a segment level (for example, various loan product types). Section 9.1.3 clarifies stakeholder roles, distinguishing responsibilities among the model owner, model developer, and model user. These details satisfy the requirement that an OGM plan must be included in the model development documentation and must list responsible parties for OGM activities.

### 2.2 Performance Tests and Monitoring Frequency

The plan indicates a biannual reporting schedule consistent with Tier 2 guidelines and describes a monthly check of early warning indicators in Section 9.3.2. It includes PSI and risk score stability to measure accuracy and robustness, fulfilling the MRO requirement to periodically assess whether the model remains appropriately implemented and performing as intended. Section 9.3.5 introduces a backtesting dimension that compares outcomes in each cycle to prior OGM metrics. These features address the MRO requirement for ongoing performance tests and for keeping track of model drift or changes over time.

### 2.3 Performance Metrics and Thresholds

Table 9-17 presents distinct Green, Yellow, and Red threshold bands for PSI, explanation coverage, and other performance metrics. Section 9.3.2 includes separate early warning thresholds intended to alert model stakeholders to performance issues before they reach the formal threshold. This meets the requirement that the OGM plan must define each metric’s threshold, including justification for selected trigger points, and must specify how they align with business rationale or historical data analysis.

### 2.4 OGM Starting Date

Sections 9.1.5.1 and 9.1.5.2 specify that the first OGM report is due on August 31, 2023, and subsequent reports follow a biannual schedule, with a 60-day submission window after each quarter for Tier 2 models. This schedule complies with the MRO OGM Submission Schedule guidance and documents the initial OGM due date. It also ensures the plan is approved before full-scale model usage, which is a requirement for new models under MRO policy.

### 2.5 Model Use Limitation

Section 9.1.4 documents the model’s reliance on MOD13512 for input data, describes potential boundary conditions (such as limited observations for new products), and discusses compensating measures (for instance, expanded data collection or sign-off from model risk committees). This addresses the requirement to include an assessment of model limitations and associated compensating measures, ensuring the model remains fit for use within its known constraints.

### 2.6 Escalation Plan

Table 9-19 explains three escalating levels of model performance: Green for acceptable operation, Yellow for borderline or concerning performance, and Red for serious deficiencies. The plan calls for root cause investigation in Yellow scenarios and for potential recalibration or redevelopment if the model is in the Red zone. The plan directs communication and escalation to the Business Unit Risk Committee (BURC) or MRO if performance remains below the acceptable thresholds. This structure satisfies the MRO requirement for specifying escalation actions and responsibilities upon threshold breaches.

### 2.7 OGM Reporting

Section 9.3.5 describes the OGM report content, including updated performance metrics, any early warning triggers since the last cycle, and the comparison against prior OGM submissions for backtesting. The plan mandates data that is no older than 60 days, aligning with MRO expectations for timeliness. This reporting structure addresses the requirement that the OGM plan define a reporting process with enough clarity to ensure periodic submissions, stakeholder review, and documented feedback.

### 2.8 Coverage of MRO OGM Requirements

The plan includes a description of the model’s purpose and scope in the documentation where it explains that MOD13627 is used for generating adverse action codes. Section 9.1.3 lists relevant model stakeholders (owners, developers, users) with assigned responsibilities for OGM tasks. Section 9.1.5 identifies the first OGM due date and the frequency, and Section 9.3.2 and Table 9-17 provide the rationale for performance metrics and thresholds. Section 9.1.3 references overlay or override tracking, clarifying that any adjustments to model outputs require documentation and potential escalation if significant. Section 9.1.4 discusses the effect of known limitations and indicates compensating measures if data or scope conditions fall outside normal ranges. Section 9.2.2 addresses OGM data controls by detailing how critical data elements are monitored and verified for accuracy, while Section 9.3.5 confirms that each OGM report will present the results of these controls. These details collectively satisfy the bullet points found under Section 2.2.8 of the MRO procedure, which require an OGM plan to incorporate purpose/scope, stakeholder responsibilities, initial due dates, test rationales, threshold definitions, escalation actions, assessment of limitations and overlays, and data controls.

## 3. Validation Review Conclusion

The OGM plan for MOD13627 ZORS Adverse Action Model is judged to be compliant with the core MRO OGM requirements, including all referenced bullets in the MRO procedure regarding plan support, performance monitoring, thresholds, and escalation. Sections 9.1.3, 9.1.4, 9.2.2, 9.3.2, 9.3.4, and 9.3.5, as well as Tables 9-17 and 9-19, comprehensively address each element of an OGM plan as outlined in the MRO guidance. These elements include a clear description of the model’s purpose and scope, a list of stakeholders with assigned OGM responsibilities, a specified initial OGM due date with a frequency aligned to Tier 2 expectations, a rationale for the chosen performance tests, a justification of thresholds (including early warning levels), processes for handling and documenting overlays or overrides, a thorough assessment of limitations and compensating measures, and data control procedures for ensuring accurate inputs.

Recommended enhancements remain optional, such as providing more stressed or real-world examples in Section 9.3.4 and further detailing variable-level sensitivities in Section 9.3.5 to augment the plan’s robustness testing. These suggestions do not affect the conclusion that the plan meets the key MRO standards for ongoing model monitoring.
