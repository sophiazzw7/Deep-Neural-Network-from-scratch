### 4.1.2 Data Quality Analysis Performed by MRO

MRO carried out additional checks on the Archer dataset (raw) and three processed tables (event_w_exclusion, event_w_exclusion_dedup, event_w_exclusion_agg) to verify completeness, consistency, and conformity with the MDD. MRO also examined each Basel Event Type segment in the final aggregated form for missingness, duplicates, and extreme outliers.

MRO notes that the developer did not conduct or document formal data quality testing, contrary to MDD guidelines. This absence of developer-driven checks is being raised as a formal finding. Accordingly, MRO performed all data quality verifications independently.

---

#### A. Raw Archer_data

- Over 111,000 records, with key numeric fields (Gross Loss Amount, Recovery Amount).  
- MRO observed no negative Gross Loss or positive Recovery, matching MDD Section 2.6’s requirement that Gross Loss ≥ 0 and recoveries ≤ 0.  
- Approximately 10,062 duplicates at (Internal Event, Posting Date). MRO confirmed these often represent partial or multi-line G/L postings for the same event.  
- Outlier testing showed net losses could exceed millions, and occasionally be negative if recoveries overshadow gross. MRO flagged both extremes for SME review.

---

#### B. event_w_exclusion (Intermediate)

- Approximately 103,081 records after applying exclusions per MDD Section 2.4 (credit boundary, EDPM G/L codes, 2018Q4 ACH fraud, etc.).  
- MRO observed 9,399 duplicates remaining. Negative net losses and large outliers persisted, consistent with multi-line postings.  
- Domain checks again showed no negative Gross or positive Recovery. The net_loss field captured both large positive and negative totals.

MRO identified specific negative net losses in the top 200 by absolute severity, led by a −$8.44 million entry (ET7, 31MAR2015) and repeated −$5.73 million entries (ET4, 31DEC2016). These large negatives may represent overshoot recoveries or data anomalies that require additional SME validation.

---

#### C. event_w_exclusion_dedup (De-Duplicated)

- Roughly 38,784 records retained after removing exact duplicates. MRO confirmed 0 duplicates remain for (Internal Event, gl_date).  
- MRO ran additional outlier testing. A “top 50 outliers by absolute severity” displayed multi-million-dollar positives (notably EF and CPBP) and negatives (IF, EDPM, etc.).  

Among the negatives, the same −$8.44 million EDPM (31MAR2015) and −$5.73 million CPBP (31DEC2016) entries appear, alongside smaller negatives (e.g., −$509k, −$250k). The developer clarified that negative net losses could be legitimate over-recovery scenarios or data anomalies, pending further validation.

---

#### D. event_w_exclusion_agg (Aggregated)

- Data aggregated to quarter (gl_date) and Basel Event Type. MRO reviewed top severity outliers, which exceeded tens of millions in EF.  
- The resulting quarterly freq = distinct events, severity = sum of net_loss. This is consistent with MDD Section 2.7 guidance on final modeling data structure.

When looking at the aggregated net_loss (event_w_exclusion_agg_net_loss), MRO noted only one negative severity in the top 200 list, −$57.58k (ET1 – Internal Fraud, 31MAR2013). While smaller in magnitude compared to other outliers, it still underscores the need to confirm these negative values as valid recoveries vs. potential miscodings.

---

#### E. Segment-Level Checks

MRO examined the final quarterly datasets for EDPM, CPBP, EF, IF, DPA, and EPWS, each containing 80 quarters (31MAR2005 to 30JUN2024):

1) EDPM  
   No missing severity. Maximum near 34 million, indicating a strongly right-skewed distribution.  
   One of the largest negative net-loss events in the unaggregated data (−$8.44 million) fell under EDPM in 2015.

2) CPBP  
   No missing severity. Some outliers above 57 million. MRO requested developer confirmation on these extremely large values.  
   Repeated −$5.73 million entries also appear at 31DEC2016 in the unaggregated views.

3) EF  
   No missing severity. Outliers can approach 66 million. Developers confirmed that the 66 million figure in EF (30SEP2008) arises from 1,042 events in that quarter, thus reflecting cumulative impacts rather than erroneous data. MRO has accepted this explanation and does not view the 66M as a data issue.

4) IF  
   Three quarters were initially missing severity but are zero-loss events. One negative severity (around −$57.58k) remains in 31MAR2013, requiring explanation regarding over-recovery or data error.

5) DPA  
   Some quarters initially showed missing severity, clarified by the developer to be zero-loss quarters (i.e., no loss events occurred). Highest severity ~3.17 million, smaller than other segments but still skewed.

6) EPWS  
   No missing severity. Some extremes in the 50–70 million range. MRO asked developers to validate these unusually large events.

### 4.1.3 Data Quality Assessment

Source Variables  
Archer is recognized as the bank’s official operational loss system, consistent with MDD references. MRO deems the source reputable for operational risk events. Data definitions appear consistent with the intended net loss usage.

Testing Adequacy  
MRO’s independent checks largely align with the developer’s outcomes, but further responses are needed to confirm:

- Negative net loss cases, especially in IF (−$57.58k), CPBP (−$5.73M), and EDPM (−$8.44M).  
- Extremely large outliers in EF, CPBP, and EPWS. Developers confirmed that, in EF, the 66M severity is driven by 1,042 events, not data errors.  
- Verification that the final two quarters of data were excluded: MRO discovered this step was performed manually in Excel, not in the SAS code, which may conflict with MDD automation guidelines.  

Additionally, MRO is formally raising a finding that the developer did not conduct any documented data quality testing. This gap could impede timely detection of issues in the pipeline and needs remediation.

Overall, MRO judges the developer’s data pipeline consistent with the heavy-tail risk profile in Archer, but recommends verifying all major outliers and negative entries with SMEs before final modeling.

### 4.2.2 Data Appropriateness Testing Performed by MRO

MRO compared the final SAS flow with the MDD:

1) Single Pull (July 15, 2022) and Exclusion of Recent Quarters  
   MRO observed references to the single date. However, the developer did not implement the last two-quarter exclusion in the SAS code; instead, MRO confirmed the developer applied this in Excel as a manual step. MRO awaits a formal code-based or documented approach to ensure reproducibility.

2) Net Loss (Gross + Recovery)  
   MRO checked that Recovery Amount is stored as a negative and thus effectively subtracts from Gross. This is consistent with MDD Section 2.6’s net-loss decision.

3) Aggregation from G/L Lines to Event, Then to Quarter  
   MRO verified the code’s use of min(Posting Date) for each event (earliest date) and the final grouping by gl_date (quarter). This step meets Section 2.3.1’s “use earliest posting date as event charge-off date.”

4) Manual Exclusions  
   The code excludes credit boundary, mis-categorized EDPM accounts, 2018Q4 ACH Fraud, and outliers from Exclusion_IE.xlsx. MRO confirmed each rule matches the MDD’s “Approved Data Exclusions.”

5) Addressing Missing Data and Duplicates  
   MRO validated that in IF and DPA, quarters appearing to have missing severity were zero-loss quarters with no events. Duplicates are resolved in event_w_exclusion_dedup. MRO finds these transformations appropriate for operational risk modeling.

As with data quality, the developer also did not document any independent data appropriateness testing procedures. MRO thus conducted these checks autonomously and is raising a finding regarding the lack of developer-driven validation.
