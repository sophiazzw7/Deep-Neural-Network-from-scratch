MRO concludes the dataset is relevant and representative for operational risk modeling, capturing quarterly frequency and severity by Basel Event Type. The final transformations mostly align with the MDD, though certain details require further clarity:

- Verifying **negative net losses** (especially −\$8.44M EDPM, −\$5.73M CPBP, and −\$57.58k IF).  
- **Confirming that manual exclusion of the final two quarters has been correctly applied** and updating the code or documentation accordingly.  
- Ensuring version control for the Archer data pull to prevent restatement risks.

**MRO also highlights the lack of developer-run data quality and data appropriateness testing.** These issues do not necessarily invalidate the dataset but represent significant process gaps. Once resolved, MRO considers the data cleaning, outlier handling, and aggregation processes adequately suited for the model’s objectives.
