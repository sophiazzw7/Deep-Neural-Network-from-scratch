### **7. Change in Model Code**  

- **Transition from Quantitative to Qualitative Approach:**  
  - Since the model is no longer using a **negative binomial regression framework** for EF and CPBP, the associated **SAS code for regression-based frequency estimation** has been removed.  
  - The code now follows a **simpler multiplier-based approach**, calculating frequency and severity directly from **Archer data** without macroeconomic dependencies.  

- **Data Handling Adjustments:**  
  - **Previously, the model code only stored raw data for IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS.**  
  - Now, **EF and CPBP loss event data are also stored**, ensuring **consistent input handling across all six event types**.  
  - The data aggregation process remains **SAS-based** and continues to extract data from **Archer**, but with adjustments to accommodate the **qualitative methodology**.  

- **Removal of Negative Binomial Components:**  
  - Any **references to negative binomial regression estimation, dispersion parameters, and macroeconomic variables** have been eliminated from the production model.  
  - **Sophia confirmed** that these changes were necessary to align the model code with the updated methodology.  

- **Code Execution and Testing Considerations:**  
  - The **data pooling logic remains unchanged**, but minor adjustments were required to integrate EF and CPBP event types into the updated frequency calculations.  
  - The production model will **no longer perform regression-based estimates or use economic scenario projections** for EF and CPBP.  
  - Developers will need to verify that **all frequency and severity calculations align with the newly adopted methodology** before finalizing implementation.  

### **Next Steps for Model Code Review and Validation**  
- **Validation Team Review:**  
  - Ensure that the **updated model code properly reflects the revised qualitative approach**.  
  - Confirm that **EF and CPBP data integration is complete and consistent with the methodology update**.  
  - Validate that the **frequency and severity calculations align with the documented model methodology**.  

- **Execution Control Review:**  
  - **Jane suggested reviewing Section 8 (Model Execution Controls)** to remove outdated references to **quantitative methods and overlays**.  
  - Execution controls may need further updates after full validation of the **new multiplier-based implementation**.  

- **Final Testing & Deployment Considerations:**  
  - Ensure that the **qualitative framework is correctly applied in the final production version**.  
  - Remove all obsolete references to **macro-driven modeling logic** from the documentation and implementation notes.  
  - Developers will need to provide final validation of the **adjusted data extraction and multiplier-based calculations** before release.

✔ **Update documentation to reflect execution control changes post-transition.**  
✔ **Perform final validation before updating production deployment.**  

### **Meeting Notes – Model Transition and Archer Finding Review**  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Attendees:** **Sophia, Rashmi, Jane**

### **1. Overview of Model Transition and Testing Considerations**  
- Discussion on the revised methodology for **EF and CPBP**, which now relies on a **nine-quarter average frequency** without a predictive component.  
- Rashmi emphasized that **comparison testing**, rather than traditional statistical backtesting, is appropriate. Since the model does not claim predictive ability, drawing conclusions from past behavior to forecast the future is challenging.  
- The methodology change is not just about transitioning EF and CPBP to a **qualitative approach**, but also updating **model limitations** to acknowledge the **non-predictive nature** of recent data.  

**Key Discussion Points:**  
- There was agreement that while past losses provide **historical context**, they do not serve as strong predictors of future losses.  
- Traditional statistical backtesting is not meaningful in this context because the model does not assume a predictive relationship between past and future losses.  
- The **recent nine-quarter period** is considered the best available representation of current risk exposure, **not a forecast of future losses**.  

---

### **2. Next Steps for Archer Issue and Performance Testing Review**  
- **Alex raised concerns regarding performance testing.** A follow-up meeting with Alex early next week is planned to determine the best course of action.  
- There is **no longer an OGM plan** governing the model’s performance, eliminating the need for traditional model performance monitoring.  
- **Rashmi suggested discussing the issue with Alex** to clarify whether further action is required.  
- **Sophia noted** that outdated references to **backtesting still exist in documentation**, particularly in **Section 6 of the Model Testing framework**, which might have triggered the **ongoing Archer issue**.  

---

### **3. Handling the OGM Plan and Documentation Updates**  
- **Jane suggested that rather than raising a sub-issue, the OGM plan removal should be handled as a direct documentation update.**  
- Sophia agreed and confirmed that **removing the outdated OGM plan references** would be incorporated in the final documentation update before the deadline (6th).  
- Jane also recommended that other documentation updates, such as **removing outdated references to GL data** and ensuring the model methodology accurately reflects the new framework, could be handled **without requiring additional sub-issues**.  
- **Sophia will review the execution controls section**, ensuring it remains relevant after transitioning away from a **quantitative modeling approach**.  

**Action Items:**  
- **Remove references to the OGM plan** and ensure documentation clearly states the updated monitoring framework.  
- **Ensure Section 6 of Model Testing is updated**, removing references to outdated backtesting language.  
- **Clarify in the documentation that the model does not require an OGM plan**, thus resolving **Archer Finding FND 12620126**.

### **4. Model Change Impact Analysis**  
- Since the model is shifting from **a quantitative to a qualitative framework**, traditional impact analysis methods do not apply.  
- The primary impact of the change is the **elimination of large overlays**, as **EF and CPBP now rely on a simpler multiplier-based approach**.  
- Sophia emphasized that previous reliance on overlays was a workaround to correct inconsistent model outputs. The new approach is designed to remove the need for such adjustments.  

**Key Discussion Points:**  
- **Operational loss severity and frequency** are largely **random in nature** and **do not exhibit consistent macroeconomic relationships**.  
- **EF and CPBP previously used a negative binomial regression model**, which failed to establish robust predictive relationships. The model frequently required large overlays to correct **misaligned stress forecasts**.  
- The shift to **a qualitative multiplier-based approach** ensures a more **stable and institution-specific** methodology.  
- **Jane proposed documenting the impact as a reduction in post-model adjustments**, since overlays will no longer be needed to bring the forecasts in line with observed risk patterns.  

**Action Items:**  
- **Sophia will include an explanation** in the model memo detailing the impact of moving away from overlays.  
- **Clarify in the impact analysis section** that the new methodology leads to a more stable, expert-driven assessment rather than an over-reliance on a model requiring frequent manual corrections.

### **5. Root Cause Analysis and Sub-Issue Categorization**  
- Governance requires categorization of sub-issues into **People, Process, System, or Governance** categories.  
- **Rashmi proposed initial classifications** for review by the group.  
- Sophia and Jane agreed to **review the proposed sub-issue categories** before final submission.  
- The group agreed that a **separate meeting with Alex** is needed to finalize **the performance testing Archer issue**.

### **6. Next Steps and Action Items**  

#### **By the 6th:**  
- Finalize **documentation updates**, including **OGM plan removal** and clarifications in methodology.  
- Remove outdated references to **GL data** and align model documentation with the **new qualitative framework**.  
- Ensure **backtesting references** are removed from **Model Testing Section 6**.  

#### **Monday:**  
- **Working session** to finalize **documentation updates** and **sub-issue categorization**.  
- Plan out how to communicate these changes in the next review cycle.  

#### **Early Next Week:**  
- **Meeting with Alex** to determine how to handle the **Archer performance testing issue** and whether additional clarifications are needed in the final submission.  

**Final Review:**  
- Sophia will send an **updated list of pending questions** to ensure all necessary revisions are captured before submission.
