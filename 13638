The model’s sensitivity to distribution shifts was already thoroughly tested during development, where multiple hypothetical “stress” scenarios were performed to confirm the model’s robustness. In production, PSI metrics are tracked each reporting cycle; if the population remains relatively stable, these PSI checks effectively detect any material drift in the model’s score or feature distributions. Given that such real-time monitoring is already in place and past development-stage stress tests have demonstrated the model’s resilience, additional routine sensitivity analysis is not considered necessary for ongoing monitoring.
