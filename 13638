Unlike traditional risk models, this model is not macroeconomically driven—meaning it does not rely on external economic conditions to differentiate stress levels.
As a result, the developers determined that it does not make sense to distinguish between "adverse" and "severely adverse" scenarios in terms of multiplier selection.
The same 3.5 multiplier and loss value are applied regardless of the severity of the stress scenario, meaning the delta remains constant across all stress cases.
This approach is consistent with the other four segments (DPA, EPWS, IF, EDPM), which also do not differentiate between adverse and severe stress scenarios.
The developers made a judgmental decision to prepare for the worst—ensuring the model remains conservative by always assuming a severe stress impact.
