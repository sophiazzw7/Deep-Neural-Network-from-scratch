The CCAR/DFAST Operational Loss Forecast Model at Truist generates quarterly operational loss estimates for six Basel event types (IF, EF, CPBP, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS) via a frequency-times-severity framework. Historically, EF and CPBP used negative binomial regression if macroeconomic predictors were found, but they have since moved to the qualitative approach used by the other four segments.

EF AND CPBP (QUALITATIVE)

Frequency:

Baseline = recent 9-quarter (9Q) moving average (no multiplier)

Stress = 9Q moving average × a qualitative multiplier (e.g., 3.5)

Severity:

Based on a broader “development period” average.

The stress multiplier is a simpler, judgment-based factor replacing the old macro-driven approach.

IF, EDPM, DPA, AND EPWS (MULTIPLIER-BASED)

These four segments rely on defined multipliers for frequency, derived from comparing each quarter’s 9Q moving average frequency to a ‘development average’ frequency:

Step A: Compute the development average frequency over a long historical window.
Step B: For each quarter in that window, calculate a 9Q moving average frequency.
Step C: Form a ratio = (9Q moving average) ÷ (development average).
Step D: Sort these ratios to find the 95th percentile, identifying a “stress threshold” and hence a stress period.
Step E: The stress frequency multiplier is set at or near that 95th-percentile ratio.
Step F: Exclude that stress period from the dataset and compute the ratio of the remaining data’s average frequency to the total development average. This becomes the non-stress frequency multiplier.

Hence:

Baseline Frequency = (Recent 9Q Frequency) × (Non-Stress Frequency Multiplier)

Stress Frequency = (Recent 9Q Frequency) × (Stress Frequency Multiplier)

Severity:

Uses the development-period average severity.

Baseline vs. stress severity multipliers follow a similar 95th-percentile logic, except focusing on rolling 9Q severity vs. the development average. The top 5% of severity ratios defines the stress threshold.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

EF/CPBP:

Baseline Forecast = (9Q Avg Frequency) × (9Q Avg Severity)

Stress Forecast = (9Q Avg Frequency) × (9Q Avg Severity) × (Qualitative Stress Multiplier)

IF, EDPM, DPA, EPWS:

Baseline Forecast = Baseline Frequency × Baseline Severity

Stress Forecast = Stress Frequency × Stress Severity

Where Baseline/Stress Frequency and Severity each draw on the respective multipliers identified via the 95th-percentile approach.

MODEL CHANGES

Removal of Negative Binomial Regression for EF & CPBP
EF and CPBP previously used a macro-driven approach for frequency. Weak correlations led to large manual overlays. Now, EF and CPBP rely solely on a 9Q average for baseline and a qualitative stress factor (e.g., 3.5) for stress.

Unified Multiplier Logic for the Other Four Segments
IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS refine both frequency and severity with multipliers. They use rolling 9Q averages, a development-period average, and percentile-based thresholds (often 95th) to distinguish stress from non-stress. This ensures consistent stress quantification while retaining some customization for each event type’s historical distribution.

By aligning EF/CPBP with the simpler, all-internal approach and maintaining the established multiplier-based framework for the other four, the model delivers more consistent, institution-specific forecasts without relying on tenuous macroeconomic relationships.
