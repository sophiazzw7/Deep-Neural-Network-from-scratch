**Model Validation Plan Assessment:**

MRO reviewed the updates in Section 6.3 (Scenario Analysis Documentation) of the Model Development Documentation (MDD), which now includes interpretation of scenario analysis results for EF and CPBP event types using the CCAR 2022 submission scenarios. While the revised documentation acknowledges the potential influence of macroeconomic variables on the observed scenario frequency outcomes, the enhancements remain predominantly qualitative. Specifically, Section 6.3 lacks rigorous quantitative evidence—such as statistical testing, correlation analyses, or scenario-specific sensitivity evaluations—to substantiate the claim that macroeconomic conditions fully explain the frequency ranking reversals observed for the CPBP event type.

Further, the revised documentation in Section 6.3 does not clarify why this rank reversal occurs in CPBP frequencies but not in EF frequencies. If macroeconomic variables are indeed the driver, it is unclear why their effect would differ so markedly between the two event types. Without targeted empirical support, such as quantitative metrics of model performance under varied macroeconomic conditions, the reasoning presented remains insufficient to confirm that the scenario frequency reversal is consistent and explainable model behavior.

**Conclusion and Next Steps:**

Although Section 6.3 of the MDD has been improved in terms of providing additional context and reasoning, the absence of robust, data-driven evidence and a clear explanation for event-type-specific discrepancies leaves key points unresolved. As a result, MRO only partially closes Bullet 1 of FND-17134827 at this time.

To achieve full closure, MRO has opened a new sub-issue (MR1) requesting the following actions by the model developers:

1. Incorporate additional quantitative analyses within Section 6.3 (or a designated subsection) to demonstrate statistically and empirically that macroeconomic variables drive the observed ranking reversals.
2. Include a focused comparison within Section 6.3 that explains why the CPBP event type experiences rank reversals under certain scenarios while EF does not, ensuring that the event-type differences are clearly justified through quantitative evidence.

Closure of Bullet 1 will depend on the thoroughness and clarity of these enhancements in the revised MDD.

=====
While the developers have improved the documentation by adding interpretative content to Section 6.3, the lack of robust evidence supporting the ranking reversal and the unclear differentiation between EF and CPBP event types prevent full closure of the issue. MRO therefore marks Bullet 1 of FND-17134827 as partially closed and opens a sub-issue (MR1) to address the remaining concerns.

On this basis, MRO considers Bullet 1 of FND-17134827 to be partially resolved and is therefore closing Bullet 1. To address the remaining concerns, MRO is reopening these issues as MR1.


=======**Model Validation Plan Assessment:**

MRO reviewed the updated Model Development Documentation (MDD), specifically **Section 5.5**, as referenced in FND-17134827 Bullet 2. The initial finding noted that the MDD did not include documentation of the multicollinearity and serial correlation tests performed for the final model specification assumptions.

Following the remediation plan, the MDD has been revised to incorporate the assessment of these tests. The updated documentation now presents:

- **Multicollinearity Test Results:**  
  The MDD includes correlation tables and corresponding p-values for the variables used in the model. These tables demonstrate that the interaction terms are not statistically significant and that correlation coefficients remain low or insignificant. As noted by the model developers, this indicates that the hypothesis of multicollinearity is not supported by the data. The conclusion explicitly states that the assumption of variables being appropriately independent is satisfied.

- **Serial Correlation Test Results:**  
  The MDD also includes residual plots derived from the final Negative Binomial regression. These plots show no discernible pattern or trend over time. The absence of systematic structure in the residuals supports the conclusion that serial correlation is not present.

**Conclusion and Next Steps:**

By adding the missing assessments, the model developers have addressed the documentation gap previously identified. The MDD now provides sufficient evidence that multicollinearity and serial correlation were tested and found not to be problematic. MRO concludes that the remediation measures meet the expectations outlined in the finding. As a result, FND-17134827 Bullet 2 can be closed.

**Model Validation Plan Assessment:**

MRO reviewed the updated Model Development Documentation (MDD), specifically **Section 6.1.1**, which now includes back-testing results over the development period (Q1 2005–Q4 2021), the most recent nine quarters (Q4 2019–Q4 2021), and the Great Financial Recession period (2008Q1–2010Q1). While the MDD presents some performance metrics (e.g., MAPE), these appear to focus on severity and do not include back-testing results for frequency. Without frequency-related back-testing data, MRO cannot evaluate whether the forecasted number of events aligns with historical patterns, leaving a notable gap in the assessment of model performance.

Furthermore, the updated documentation provides interpretation primarily for EF and CPBP event types but not for EDPM, IF, DPA, or EPWS. There is no qualitative or quantitative commentary on how these other event types performed relative to historical benchmarks, nor is it clear how their back-testing results were calculated. Without insights into the calculation methodology, MRO cannot determine whether the presented results are reliable or consistent with the model’s intended framework.

Additionally, the MDD references that the observed variance is considered acceptable within certain “tolerance limits” recognized by model owners. However, these tolerance limits are not defined, and no evidence is provided to confirm that model owners have formally accepted these variance levels. Without explicit thresholds and documented acceptance, MRO cannot confirm that the observed discrepancies align with internal standards or industry expectations.

**Conclusion:**

Although the updated MDD includes more back-testing information than before, the lack of frequency results, absence of interpretation for event types beyond EF and CPBP, undefined tolerance limits, and the lack of clarity on calculation methods for EDPM, IF, DPA, and EPWS results prevent MRO from concluding that the initial concerns have been adequately addressed.



In summary, FND-17134827 has undergone partial resolution. While Bullets 1 and 2 have been addressed (with Bullet 1 partially resolved and Bullet 2 fully resolved), Bullet 3 remains unresolved. To manage the remaining issues comprehensively, FND-17134827 is now considered closed, and all unresolved or pending aspects have been reopened as MR1, which consolidates the pending requirements for further remediation.
MRO finds that the remediation evidence submitted does not fully address the risk identified in Bullet 3 of FND-17134827. Additional clarity and comprehensive data, including frequency back-testing, event-type-specific interpretations, explicit tolerance limits, and a clear explanation of how back-testing results for all event types are calculated, will be required before closure can be considered.
