The documentation has adequately addressed bullet 7 by clarifying that attributes with a missing rate above 50% were filtered out due to the smaller sample size and PSIâ€™s sensitivity to missing rates during the UAT period. This explicitly confirms that the calculation of Metric 1 accounted for missingness thresholds, ensuring that only sufficiently populated features were included in the PSI computation. Given this clarification, the concern regarding whether features with >50% missingness were removed has been resolved. If further details on the baseline calculation of Metric 1 are needed, additional documentation may be referenced.
