## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Metric 2 & Stability Testing
- Rashmi explained that Metric 2 currently looks at *p-values* to determine stability, i.e., whether coefficients have predictive power.  
- Sophia (on behalf of MRO) suggested introducing a new metric to also track the *magnitude* of re-estimated coefficients (e.g., a threshold for how much a coefficient can change before it raises concerns about model stability).  
- Jane pointed out this is a good suggestion but would require *significant analysis* and more time for development.  
- Rashmi clarified that while no explicit numeric threshold is in place today, the team does examine large coefficient changes to determine if data shifts are *permanent* or *transitory* and then decides whether to re-estimate.

Outcome/Decision:  
- The group agreed to document these concerns in the limitation section of the OGM or model documentation, ensuring stakeholders are aware of potential stability issues.  
- Potentially adding a new stability metric will be treated as a longer-term improvement rather than something to finalize in the current annual review.

### 2. New OGM Plan & Annual Review Scope
- Sophia clarified that the new OGM plan is part of the annual review (RP2) and that these timelines overlap.  
- Rashmi noted there was earlier confusion: the team initially understood the new OGM plan might not be in scope for this annual review.  
- Jane emphasized a desire to ensure the OGM plan is compliant and meets annual review requirements.

Outcome/Decision:  
- All parties agreed that the new OGM plan will be reviewed as part of the annual review process.  
- If some of the desired enhancements (e.g., new metrics) are not ready, they can be documented as pending or suggested improvements for future updates.

### 3. Archer Finding [126202126]
- Sophia and Kuldeep highlighted concerns about *over-prediction* or large discrepancies in some segments (e.g., CTEP, EF) when re-estimated.  
- The Archer Finding is tied to *testing* and *validation.*  
- Jane recognized the overlap with *model stability concerns* but noted some items may remain open until the next cycle if they require more development.  
- The governance team will decide whether these concerns rise to the level of an issue or sub-issue or if they should be handled as a suggestion.

Outcome/Decision:  
- The team will address the Archer Finding within the annual review window (ending February 7).  
- If any items remain unresolved, they will be flagged for ongoing or future governance consideration.

### 4. Code Changes & Backtesting Questions
- Sophia raised a question about unplanned code changes in the folders and asked who made them and why.  
- Rashmi will investigate the code changes, as they may have been *minor or routine updates,* but they still fall under the scope of the annual validation.  
- Kuldeep described replication efforts for Metric 3 calculations and found discrepancies between the OGM report’s aggregated results and their own breakdown.  
- Rashmi explained that older OGM reports don’t include the breakdown (only aggregations), but future OGM reports will provide separate breakdowns.

Outcome/Decision:  
- Rashmi will review the code changes and clarify why and when they were made.  
- Both sides will exchange the breakdown calculations (Excel files, etc.) to pinpoint any discrepancy and ensure alignment.

### 5. Timeline & Next Steps
- Sophia and Rashmi discussed the various deliverables:  
  1. Response to the second question list (10 questions, some have been removed/merged).  
  2. Archer Finding responses.  
  3. OGM documentation updates, including any mention of limitations and potential sub-issues.  
- Jane suggested meeting with Alex to coordinate the final timeline.

Outcome/Decision:  
- The team will set a follow-up meeting with Alex to solidify delivery dates for question lists and Archer Finding responses.  
- Written responses to the question lists and a plan for next steps will be shared shortly after internal reviews.

## Action Items

1. Document Limitation  
   - Owner: Jane / Rashmi  
   - Task: Add explicit mention of potential stability concerns (coefficient changes) in the limitations section of the model documentation.  
   - Due: By the next draft of OGM documentation.

2. Investigate Code Changes  
   - Owner: Rashmi  
   - Task: Determine who made changes in the code folders, why, and confirm they are *routine or authorized.*  
   - Due: Provide an update at the next meeting.

3. Share Calculation Breakdowns  
   - Owner: Rashmi (with Sophia & Kuldeep)  
   - Task: Exchange the Excel sheets / breakdown logic used for Metric 3 to reconcile any discrepancies between the OGM report and the replication exercises.  
   - Due: ASAP, ideally before the next session.

4. Coordinate Archer Finding & Next Steps  
   - Owner: Rashmi / Jane / Sophia  
   - Task: Finalize how the Archer Finding [126202126] feedback will be incorporated or documented within the annual review timeframe.  
   - Due: Before the February 7 deadline.

5. Discuss Proposed Additional Metric  
   - Owner: All participants + Governance Team  
   - Task: Consider developing a new coefficient-magnitude metric for stability testing in the longer term; evaluate feasibility and approach.  
   - Due: Longer-term; no immediate date set.

6. Meet with Alex  
   - Owner: Rashmi / Jane / Sophia  
   - Task: Clarify final timeline for question-list deliverables, Archer Finding, and OGM documentation updates.  
   - Due: Scheduled for this afternoon’s session (or whenever Alex is available).

### Additional Notes
- The annual review is set to conclude by February 7. Any outstanding items may be documented as suggested improvements or pending sub-issues in the governance process.  
- The Archer Finding specifically addresses some testing concerns; however, if not fully resolved in this cycle, it will carry forward as a known item for the next review.
