**Review Conclusion and Model Rating**  
As a high-level summary, MRO finds that the model’s **qualitative methodology** is fundamentally sound for operational risk forecasting, aligning with industry practice and addressing prior weaknesses in macro-driven regression. The updated approach for EF and CPBP appears more consistent with the inherently idiosyncratic nature of operational losses. However, MRO’s review identified several sub-issues that must be addressed to ensure the model remains reliable and fully compliant with governance requirements:

1. **Data Quality & Appropriateness (F_01)**  
   – Additional data quality testing and negative severity investigations are needed to confirm the integrity of Archer datasets.

2. **Model Implementation (F_02)**  
   – Section 7 requires updates reflecting the newly adopted approach; production code and implementation testing must be documented.

3. **Model Documentation (F_03)**  
   – The documentation should remove obsolete references (GL data, negative binomial regression) and include essential items such as model exposure, business continuity, and frequency multipliers.

4. **Model Change & Operational Control (F_04)**  
   – Section 8 Model Execution Controls must align with the qualitative approach, and model operating procedures should reflect the removal of the OGM plan.

Based on these findings, MRO concludes that while the **model data and methodology** are appropriate for the bank’s CCAR/DFAST objectives, **resolving these sub-issues** is necessary to strengthen model transparency, execution controls, and data integrity. Pending remediation, the model retains a “**Fit for Use, with Caution**” rating, subject to close monitoring of the identified sub-issues.
