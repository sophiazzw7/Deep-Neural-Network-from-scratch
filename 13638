## **1. Identified Risk Items**

This table lists the **monitoring elements** reviewed in the OGM plan to assess completeness against MRO requirements.  
(**Note:** “Included” means the plan explicitly references and addresses that element in the indicated sections.)

| **Ref No.** | **Monitoring Element**                                                       | **Included in OGM Plan** | **Related Metric No.** | **MRO Assessment for Excluded Elements**                                                                                                                                   |

## **2. OGM Plan Assessment**

### **2.1 OGM Plan Granularity**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **9.1.3** (OGM Governance & Roles)  
  - **9.3.2** (Detailed Metrics Setup)  
  - **9.3.5** (Historical & Benchmarking)

**Evaluation:**  
- The plan is **appropriately detailed**, covering inputs, performance checks, and escalation triggers at a **segment level**.  
- Stakeholder responsibilities (owner, developer, user) are spelled out in **Section 9.1.3**, with each role clearly defined for the OGM process.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Complies** with MRO’s requirement for clarity on roles and responsibilities, plus the detail needed to replicate or audit the monitoring processes.

---

### **2.2 Performance Tests and Monitoring Frequency**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **9.3.2** (Early Warning Indicators)  
  - **9.3.5** (Historical Model Performance)

**Evaluation:**  
- The plan indicates **biannual** OGM reports (consistent with Tier 2) and a **monthly** internal check of early warning metrics.  
- Performance metrics include PSI, risk score stability, and top decline reasons coverage.  
- **Section 9.3.5** references an approach to compare each cycle’s results with prior OGM results (backtesting dimension).

**Conclusion:**  
- The plan **meets** Tier 2 frequency requirements and **exceeds** them via monthly early warning checks.

---

### **2.3 Performance Metrics and Thresholds**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **Table 9-17** (Green/Yellow/Red thresholds)  
  - **Section 9.3.2** (Early Warning Thresholds)

**Evaluation:**  
- PSI thresholds are expressed (e.g., Green if PSI < 10%, Yellow 10%–25%, Red > 25%); similarly defined for risk score stability.  
- **Section 9.3.2** describes early warning thresholds which are **slightly more conservative** than the official breach points—intended to detect performance drift sooner.  
- The plan references prior performance data to justify these thresholds (as stated in the same section), rather than using arbitrary values.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Fully compliant** with MRO’s requirement to define and justify thresholds, including a separate early warning layer.

---

### **2.4 OGM Starting Date**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **9.1.5.1** (First OGM Submission)  
  - **9.1.5.2** (Submission Window)

**Evaluation:**  
- The plan specifies **08/31/2023** as the first due date, aligning with a **60-day** window after quarter-end.  
- The same frequency applies every six months (Q2 and Q4 cycles) in alignment with **Tier 2** models.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Meets** MRO scheduling guidelines for Tier 2 (biannual) OGM reporting.

---

### **2.5 Model Use Limitation**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **9.1.4** (Limitations)

**Evaluation:**  
- Lists known constraints, such as dependence on upstream model **MOD13512** for input data.  
- Highlights boundary conditions (e.g., sample size < 500 for new product lines), which trigger a deeper review.  
- Mentions **compensating measures** (e.g., expanded data collection, additional sign-offs) if limitations become severe.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Fully compliant** with the requirement to document limitations and mitigating actions.

---

### **2.6 Escalation Plan**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **Table 9-19** (Performance Category & Escalation)  

**Evaluation:**  
- Outlines standard color-coded approach:  
  - **Green**: standard monitoring, no immediate change.  
  - **Yellow**: investigate root causes (e.g., data shift), consider adjusting overlays.  
  - **Red**: possible redevelopment or recalibration, immediate involvement of MRO.  
- Communicates results to **BURC** and MRO for any threshold breach beyond Yellow.

**Conclusion:**  
- Escalation path is **clearly documented** and aligned with MRO’s guidelines on performance breach management.

---

### **2.7 OGM Reporting**  
- **Documentation Sections Referenced:**  
  - **9.3.5** (Reporting Structure & Benchmarking)

**Evaluation:**  
- The plan mandates a **formal OGM report** each cycle, which includes:  
  - Updated performance metrics  
  - Any early warning triggers from monthly checks  
  - Comparison to prior OGM cycles (backtesting dimension)  
- Data used in these reports must be **no older than 60 days** from the submission date, per the text in **Section 9.3.5**.

**Conclusion:**  
- The reporting mechanism is **well-defined**, covering content, timing, and stakeholder review.

## **3. Validation Review Conclusion**

### **Validation Outcome:**  
**Compliant – No High-Risk Deficiencies**

After careful review of **Sections 9.1.3, 9.1.4, 9.2.2, 9.3.2, 9.3.4, 9.3.5,** and the referenced **Tables (9-17, 9-19)**, the **OGM plan for MOD13627 ZORS Adverse Action Model** appears **comprehensive** and **aligned** with MRO requirements. Key components (performance metrics, escalation, limitations, overlays, and data controls) are **adequately addressed** in the documentation.

### **Key Observations**  
1. **Early Warning Indicators** (Section 9.3.2) provide a **proactive** approach, beyond standard thresholds.  
2. **Thorough Limitations Discussion** (Section 9.1.4) with **compensating measures** ensures the model is not used beyond its valid scope.  
3. **Overlay/Override Documentation** (Section 9.1.3) captures qualitative adjustments, sign-offs, and triggers for further analysis.  
4. **Comprehensive Reporting** (Section 9.3.5) includes benchmarking vs. prior cycles, promoting transparency in performance trends.

### **Recommended Enhancements**  
Although the plan is compliant, MRO typically welcomes further improvements:  
- **Stress Testing Details (Section 9.3.4)**: The plan references scenario analysis; adding more real-world examples of stressed conditions could strengthen robustness checks.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis Expansion**: Section 9.3.5 could detail how each variable or factor influences the final score, including a standardized approach for measuring partial dependencies.

Overall, these enhancements are **optional** and **do not** constitute compliance issues. The OGM plan, as written, satisfies the ongoing monitoring expectations under MRO procedure for **Tier 2** models.
