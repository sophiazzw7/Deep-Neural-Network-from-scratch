Segment 1: EDPM (Execution, Delivery, and Process Management) • Data covers 80 quarterly observations (31MAR2005 to 30JUN2024), each with valid severity. • Severity ranges from around 1,017,009 to about 34,300,000, creating a heavily skewed distribution. • Mean severity is roughly 7.55 million, while the standard deviation is around 4.53 million. • No quarters are flagged as missing severity. The developer clarified that all quarters have valid event data or zero event counts as needed. • The presence of a future date (30JUN2024) may indicate a scenario or forecast horizon.
Segment 2: CPBP (Clients, Products & Business Practices) • Contains 80 quarterly records, no missing severity. • Severity spans from approximately 84,480 to over 57,000,000, leading to a very high skew. • Mean is about 6.65 million, and standard deviation is roughly 11.48 million, surpassing the mean. • No missing data are reported; the developer confirmed that zero-loss quarters were properly recorded as frequency = 0 and severity = 0, not coded as missing. • We have asked developers to verify extremely large outliers (above 50 million) but have not received a response yet.
Segment 3: EF (External Fraud) • Consists of 80 quarters with no severity flagged as missing. • Severity ranges from around 2.29 million to nearly 66.17 million, with a mean near 10.97 million and a standard deviation of 12.64 million. • Large single events account for much of the distribution’s tail. • All zero-loss quarters, if any, are confirmed as severity = 0 rather than missing. • Follow-up questions about multiple events in the 50+ million range were sent to the developer, who has not yet responded.
Segment 4: IF (Internal Fraud) • Includes 80 quarters, with three quarters originally showing missing severity. The developer clarified that these represent zero-loss quarters. • One quarter’s severity is negative (-57,584), suggesting that recoveries exceeded gross loss or a data-entry error. We asked for additional explanation on this negative value. • The highest severity is around 3.05 million, while the mean is roughly 520,000 and the standard deviation is 2.63 million. • Overall, the distribution is highly skewed. Negative net loss is not impossible but warrants further verification.
Segment 5: DPA (Damage to Physical Assets) • Has 80 quarterly observations, with eight quarters previously labeled as missing severity. According to the developer, these correspond to zero-loss quarters (frequency = 0, severity = 0). • Severity runs from 5,000 to around 3.17 million, yielding a mean of about 418,000 and a standard deviation near 624,000. • Several quarters have outliers above 1 million, though not as large as in other segments. • The developer confirmed that no-loss periods are explicitly recorded, resolving the missing-data concern.
Segment 6: EPWS (Employment Practices & Workplace Safety) • Consists of 80 quarters, no severity flagged as missing. • Severity can reach the tens of millions (some outputs showed as high as 50 to 70 million), giving a heavily skewed distribution. • Mean severity is about 2.52 million, and the standard deviation is around 2.02 million. • We requested additional details on the highest outliers (for instance, certain quarters exceeding tens of millions), but the developer’s response is still pending.
Overall Data Observations • All segments cover 80 quarters from 31MAR2005 to 30JUN2024. The final date is assumed to be a forecast or scenario period if not purely historical. • Missing severity in IF and DPA was clarified by the developer as simply zero-loss quarters rather than data-entry gaps. • Each dataset is heavily right-skewed, consistent with the nature of operational risk events. CPBP, EF, and EPWS in particular show extremely large outliers. • We have asked developers for further details on unusually high-severity quarters in EF, CPBP, and EPWS, as well as the negative severity in IF. They have not yet provided an update. • Duplicates are not observed at the quarterly level in any segment.
These clarifications help confirm that no genuine data gaps exist where severity was truly unknown. However, final validation of the largest outliers (and the negative net loss in IF) is still pending until the developers respond to our follow-up questions.
