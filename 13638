Below is the updated report with the requested changes incorporated, reflecting MRO’s finding that the developer did not conduct or document formal data quality or data appropriateness testing, clarifications on the manual exclusion of the final two quarters, confirmation that missing severities in IF and DPA are zero-loss, and that the 66M outlier in EF is a normal result of having 1,042 events in that quarter rather than a data issue. All references to these points are woven into the original text without bold formatting:

4.1 Data Quality

4.1.1 Data Quality Analysis Performed by Model Developer

The developer relies on Archer data pulled on July 15, 2022, consistent with Section 2.3.1 of the MDD, which prescribes a static snapshot to avoid restatement issues. Section 2.3 further states that the last two quarters of data should be excluded to mitigate the “dynamic entry issue,” wherein net loss amounts can be updated post-event.

Although the developer’s documentation references certain checks—such as retaining only records labeled “Event with GL Impact 10K+,” excluding credit boundary events, specific EDPM G/L codes, 2018Q4 ACH fraud, and 11 identified outliers (Exclusion_IE.xlsx)—MRO observed no formal, documented data quality or data appropriateness testing procedures conducted by the developer. The developer’s code did not explicitly exclude the final two quarters; instead, MRO confirmed that step was performed manually in Excel. These points are raised as findings for remediation.

The developer’s approach also aggregates Archer’s G/L-level entries to the event level, assigning each event’s date to the earliest posting date. Section 2.3.1 calls for monthly data to be rolled to quarterly for final modeling. The developer indicates that large outliers reflect actual high-impact operational loss events unless proven otherwise, and that negative severity values (if recoveries exceed gross loss) are typically retained unless excluded by policy.

4.1.2 Data Quality Analysis Performed by MRO

MRO carried out additional checks on the Archer dataset (raw) and three processed tables (event_w_exclusion, event_w_exclusion_dedup, event_w_exclusion_agg) to verify completeness, consistency, and conformity with the MDD. MRO also examined each Basel Event Type segment in the final aggregated form for missingness, duplicates, and extreme outliers.

A. Raw Archer_data

- Over 111,000 records, with key numeric fields (Gross Loss Amount, Recovery Amount).  
- MRO observed no negative Gross Loss or positive Recovery, matching MDD Section 2.6’s requirement that Gross Loss ≥ 0 and recoveries ≤ 0.  
- Approximately 10,062 duplicates at (Internal Event, Posting Date). MRO confirmed these often represent partial or multi-line G/L postings for the same event.  
- Outlier testing showed net losses could exceed millions, and occasionally be negative if recoveries overshadow gross. MRO flagged both extremes for SME review.

B. event_w_exclusion (Intermediate)

- Approximately 103,081 records after applying exclusions per MDD Section 2.4 (credit boundary, EDPM G/L codes, 2018Q4 ACH fraud, etc.).  
- MRO observed 9,399 duplicates remaining. Negative net losses and large outliers persisted, consistent with multi-line postings.  
- Domain checks again showed no negative Gross or positive Recovery. The net_loss field captured both large positive and negative totals.

C. event_w_exclusion_dedup (De-Duplicated)

- Roughly 38,784 records retained after removing exact duplicates. MRO confirmed 0 duplicates remain for (Internal Event, gl_date).  
- MRO ran additional outlier testing. A “top 50 outliers by absolute severity” displayed multi-million-dollar positives (notably EF and CPBP) and negatives (IF, EDPM, etc.).  
- The developer clarified that negative net losses could be legitimate over-recovery scenarios or data anomalies, pending further validation.

D. event_w_exclusion_agg (Aggregated)

- Data aggregated to quarter (gl_date) and Basel Event Type. MRO reviewed top severity outliers, which exceeded tens of millions in EF.  
- The resulting quarterly freq = distinct events, severity = sum of net_loss. This is consistent with MDD Section 2.7 guidance on final modeling data structure.

E. Segment-Level Checks

MRO examined the final quarterly datasets for EDPM, CPBP, EF, IF, DPA, and EPWS, each containing 80 quarters (31MAR2005 to 30JUN2024):

1) EDPM  
   No missing severity. Maximum near 34 million, indicating a strongly right-skewed distribution.

2) CPBP  
   No missing severity. Some outliers above 57 million. MRO requested developer confirmation on these extremely large values.

3) EF  
   No missing severity. Outliers can approach 66 million. Developers explained that in at least one quarter, the 66M figure results from 1,042 events in that period, indicating a cumulative effect rather than a data error.

4) IF  
   Three quarters were initially missing severity, which the developer clarified are zero-loss quarters where no events occurred. One negative severity of about -57,584 was identified, requiring explanation regarding over-recovery or data error.

5) DPA  
   Eight quarters initially missing severity, which the developer explained are also zero-loss quarters. Highest severity ~3.17 million, smaller than other segments but still skewed.

6) EPWS  
   No missing severity. Some extremes in the 50–70 million range. MRO asked developers to validate these unusually large events.

4.1.3 Data Quality Assessment

Source Variables  
Archer is recognized as the bank’s official operational loss system, consistent with MDD references. MRO deems the source reputable for operational risk events. Data definitions appear consistent with the intended net loss usage.

Testing Adequacy  
MRO’s independent checks largely align with the developer’s outcomes, though further responses are needed to confirm:

- Negative net loss cases, especially in IF.  
- Extremely large outliers in EF, CPBP, and EPWS.  
- The explicit implementation of excluding the last two quarters from 2022, which MRO found is being done manually outside the SAS code.  

MRO also notes that the developer did not document any formal data quality testing, which is being raised as a finding. Despite these issues, the Archer dataset’s heavy-tail risk profile is not unexpected, and large or negative values may still be valid events. MRO recommends verifying all major outliers and negative entries with SMEs before final modeling.

4.2 Data Appropriateness

4.2.1 Data Appropriateness Testing Performed by Model Developer

The developer’s documented approach—aggregating multiple G/L postings per event, applying exclusions from Section 2.4, and rolling monthly data to a quarterly severity/frequency time series—aligns with MDD requirements in principle. However, as with data quality, the developer did not provide evidence of formal data appropriateness testing, relying on informal checks instead. MRO considers this an additional process gap requiring remediation.

4.2.2 Data Appropriateness Testing Performed by MRO

MRO compared the final SAS flow with the MDD:

1) Single Pull (July 15, 2022) and Exclusion of Recent Quarters  
   MRO observed references to the single date but limited evidence in code of explicit two-quarter removal. This exclusion was confirmed to be a manual Excel step rather than embedded in the SAS workflow.

2) Net Loss (Gross + Recovery)  
   MRO checked that Recovery Amount is stored as a negative and thus effectively subtracts from Gross. This is consistent with MDD Section 2.6’s net-loss decision.

3) Aggregation from G/L Lines to Event, Then to Quarter  
   MRO verified the code’s use of min(Posting Date) for each event (earliest date) and the final grouping by gl_date (quarter). This step meets Section 2.3.1’s “use earliest posting date as event charge-off date.”

4) Manual Exclusions  
   The code excludes credit boundary, mis-categorized EDPM accounts, 2018Q4 ACH Fraud, and outliers from Exclusion_IE.xlsx. MRO confirmed each rule matches the MDD’s “Approved Data Exclusions.”

5) Addressing Missing Data and Duplicates  
   MRO validated that missing severity in IF and DPA corresponded to zero-loss quarters. Duplicates are resolved in event_w_exclusion_dedup. MRO finds these transformations appropriate for operational risk modeling but notes a lack of formal developer-led testing to confirm overall data appropriateness.

4.2.3 Data Appropriateness Assessment

MRO concludes the dataset is relevant and representative for operational risk modeling, capturing quarterly frequency and severity by Basel Event Type. The final transformations mostly align with the MDD, though certain details require further clarity:

- Verifying the cutoff for excluding the most recent two quarters is consistently applied and documented in code or a reproducible workflow.  
- Finalizing validation on extremely large outliers (such as the 66M in EF) and negative net losses.  
- Ensuring version control for the Archer data pull to prevent restatement risks.  

These issues do not invalidate the dataset but highlight key process gaps. Most notably, the absence of formal data quality and data appropriateness testing by the developer is a significant finding. MRO’s own checks indicate that once these points are addressed, the data cleaning, outlier handling, and aggregation processes should be suitable for the model’s objectives.
