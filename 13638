Because the Operational Loss Forecast Model no longer relies on a macro-based (quantitative) framework, the traditional OGM plan it once fell under is no longer applicable. The new, fully qualitative approach uses a 3.5 multiplier with recent nine-quarter data, with approval and annual review from subject matter experts to confirm or revise those assumptions. As a result, the Archer finding (FND 12620126) is fully resolved; the modelâ€™s monitoring now centers on validating the reasonableness of the qualitative multiplier and updated 9Q data rather than following the legacy OGM plan provisions.
