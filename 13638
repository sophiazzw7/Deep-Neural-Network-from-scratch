The documentation has adequately addressed bullet 7 by clarifying that attributes with a missing rate above 50% were filtered out due to the smaller sample size and PSIâ€™s sensitivity to missing rates during the UAT period. This explicitly confirms that the calculation of Metric 1 accounted for missingness thresholds, ensuring that only sufficiently populated features were included in the PSI computation. Given this clarification, the concern regarding whether features with >50% missingness were removed has been resolved. If further details on the baseline calculation of Metric 1 are needed, additional documentation may be referenced.

The documentation and email from Zijian Wu effectively resolve the finding by providing a clear explanation of the discrepancies between the reported and MRO-obtained OGM results. The discrepancies arose because the OGM process initially flagged applicants as suspicious or fraudulent based on updated files from Trust each quarter. However, applicants deemed acceptable in one quarter could later be flagged as suspicious in subsequent quarters (or vice versa), leading to inconsistencies in results when re-running old analyses. To address this, the OGM notebooks were updated to pull data from quarterly snapshots instead of relying on the latest data, ensuring that results remain consistent across analyses. Additionally, a bug in the AA_OGM notebook affecting the "Measure of Explanation Coverage for Top 5 Key Factors" was identified and fixed, with only minor effects observed at the third or fourth decimal place. MRO reviewed the email from Zest dated August 12, 2024, which detailed the root cause of these discrepancies, and confirmed that the updated OGM reports have been uploaded to ServiceNow. With these changes, the discrepancies have been fully explained and resolved, and the finding is now remediated.
