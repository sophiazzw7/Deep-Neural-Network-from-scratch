### **Proposed Risk Items for Model Documentation and Implementation**

1. **Model Documentation Incompleteness and Outdated Content**
   - The model documentation lacks a **Model Risk Tier Table** and has not been updated to reflect changes in methodology. The MCA form should also be updated accordingly.
   - Figure 3 in Section 1.2, and Sections 1.5, 3, and 4.3 retain outdated assumptions and limitations from the previous quantitative approach. These sections should be revised to align with the new methodology.
   - The documentation still references the **variable selection process** for EF and CPBP under Section 3, which is now obsolete and should be removed.
   - The description of model methodology is unclear for IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS, particularly regarding the derivation of frequency and severity multipliers, and stress period determination.

2. **Data Integrity and Appropriateness Issues**
   - The model documentation references **GL data**, despite confirmation from the development team that it is not used due to data entry issues. Section 2 and figures such as **Figure 48 in Section 5.4** should be updated or removed to prevent confusion.
   - Data flow and treatment descriptions (e.g., **Section 2.5 of the MDD**) contain obsolete or conflicting information and need to be revised.
   - **Negative severity values** (e.g., **-57,583.81 in the IF segment**) were identified, requiring investigation into their appropriateness.
   - The presence of **negative loss values in Event_w_exclusion and Event_w_exclusion_dedup** should be assessed for validity, and additional data controls may be necessary.
   - Developerâ€™s **data quality and appropriateness testing** are not documented. A clear framework for data validation should be established.

3. **Model Implementation Gaps**
   - The **production code** for the revised methodology is **not yet finalized**, and an implementation sub-issue should be raised.
   - Sections **7 (Model Implementation) and 8 (Model Use Controls)** have not been revised to reflect qualitative methodology changes and require updates upon finalization.

4. **Regulatory and Policy Compliance**
   - **Policy and procedure references** should be reassessed and updated to ensure alignment with the new qualitative model framework.
   - The model exposure, including **portfolio size or risk types impacted**, should be explicitly stated in the documentation.
   - The documentation lacks a **Business Continuity and Contingency Plan**, which should be provided.

5. **Performance Monitoring and OGM Plan Updates**
   - With the qualitative transition, the **traditional OGM plan no longer applies** and should be removed. Instead, the **EF/CPBP multipliers and recent 9Q data should be reassessed annually**.
   - The **stress period for IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS should be reviewed annually**, and **enhanced data control measures** are recommended.

6. **Stakeholder Review and Documentation Updates**
   - The **list of key model stakeholders** should be reviewed and confirmed to reflect current ownership and responsibilities.
   - The model documentation should be updated to conform to the **latest MDD template standards**.

This structured risk summary consolidates key issues, eliminating redundancy while maintaining clarity and completeness. Let me know if you need further refinements.
