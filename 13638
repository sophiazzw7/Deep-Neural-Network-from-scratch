## **1. Model Description**  
The **Zest ML Probability of Default Model (MOD13512)** is a vended machine-learning (ML) model used in the **LightStream** business. Developed by Zest AI in Q4 2022, the model generates the **ZestAI Obligation Risk Score (ZORS)** for each loan application. ZORS is used by LightStream underwriting to make lending decisions; specifically, the model predicts the probability that a loan will become **60+ days past due (DPD)** within **18 months** of origination.

- **Implementation Date**: October 26, 2022  
- **Model Developer**: Zest AI  
- **LightStream 2023 Production Volume**: \$2.79 billion (estimated)  
- **Upstream/Downstream Relationship**:  
  - **Downstream**: MOD13627 (generates Adverse Action Reason Codes)  
  - **Upstream**: LightStream Data Warehouse / Application Data  

Zest AI has proprietary development processes, so only limited methodological details (e.g., modeling approach in XGBoost, key features) were provided in the original submission.

## **2. Model Change / Purpose of This Memorandum**  
This memorandum serves as the **ongoing monitoring (OGM) report** for MOD13512, detailing how performance metrics, thresholds, and escalation procedures are defined and reviewed. It also documents the model’s approach to early warning monitoring for the **first 18 months** of performance data.

No formal *model structural changes* are proposed at this time. All identified changes relate to clarifications of the **OGM Plan** set forth in the Model Development Document (MDD).

### **3.1 OGM Plan Element Applicability Review**  
Below is a summary of the monitoring elements included or excluded in the MOD13512 OGM Plan:

| Ref No. | Monitoring Element                | Included in OGM Plan?           | Related Sections / Metrics  | MRO Assessment for Excluded Elements                |
|---------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Limitations & Assumptions Check   | **Yes**                          | 9.1.4, Table 9-18          | N/A                                                  |
| 2       | Backtesting                       | **No**                           | N/A                         | The model is production origination/underwriting; no direct “backtest” of reason codes needed. Discrimination uses AUC & KS. |

### **3.2 OGM Metrics and Thresholds**  
The **OGM Plan** uses the following **metrics**:

1. **AUC / Somers’ D** (Model Discrimination)  
   - Thresholds vary by product segment (Auto, Debt Consolidation, Home Improvement, Others), plus “All Segments” combined.  
   - Green/Yellow/Red color coding in tables 9-3 through 9-7.  
2. **K-S Statistic** (Model Discrimination)  
   - **p-value** < 0.05 (Green), 0.05–0.10 (Yellow), ≥ 0.10 (Red).  
3. **PSI** (Population Stability Index)  
   - **Feature Distribution** and **ZORS Score Distribution**.  
   - < 0.10 (Green), 0.10–0.25 (Yellow), ≥ 0.25 (Red).  

#### **Early Warning Adjustments**  
- For **months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15** performance windows, fewer “bad” events cause potential reliability issues with AUC. The OGM plan adjusts the **PSI thresholds** based on the **square root rule** (Section 9.1.2.3).  

#### **Sensitivity Analysis**  
- ZORS is artificially shifted by ±5%, ±10%, ±15%, and ±20%, and **PSI** is recalculated to assess model output stability. (Ref. Section 9.1.1.9)  
- These results are **informational only** and do not directly determine the Red/Yellow/Green rating.  

---

### **3.3 OGM Schedule**  
- **First Early Warning OGM Report**: 08/31/2023 (3 months after go-live)  
- **Subsequent EW OGM**: Quarterly (at 6, 9, 12, 15 months).  
- **First Standard OGM**: 08/31/2024 (18 months of performance).  
- **Ongoing OGM**: Semiannual (Q2 and Q4 each year).

---

### **3.4 OGM Reporting & Escalation**  
- **Green** = Performing as intended; no action.  
- **Yellow** = Performing with caution; root cause analysis (4 weeks).  
- **Red** = Not performing as intended; triggers recalibration (3–6 months). Two consecutive Red ratings trigger potential redevelopment (≥6 months).  

Governance requires notifications to the **Model Owner**, **MRM**, and other stakeholders upon any **Yellow or Red** rating.  

---

### **3.5 Data Controls and Governance**  
Per Section 9.2, OGM data are sourced from LightStream data warehouses and daily scoring logs in AWS. **Monthly** extracts capture input variables, predicted probabilities, and performance outcomes (e.g., delinquency). **Data QA checks** include:

1. **Production logs** are checked daily for errors.  
2. **OGM results** are reviewed by model development for anomalies before finalization.  
3. **Comparisons** to previous OGM cycles detect sudden shifts in record counts or distributions.  

Model stakeholders:

- **Owner/User**: LightStream Analytics (Vera Zhang)  
- **Developer**: Sr. Quantitative Model Development (Cheng Lee)  
- **Implementation Owner**: LightStream Technology / Vittorio DiMatteo

## **4. OGM Plan Assessment**

### **4.1 Adequacy of OGM Granularity**  
The plan sufficiently addresses the key risk areas for **MOD13512**:  
- **Feature and score stability** (via PSI)  
- **Model discrimination** (via AUC, KS)  
- **Alert framework** for early performance signals  

### **4.2 Performance Tests & Frequency**  
- **Early Warning OGM** on a **quarterly** basis is aligned with Tier 1 model risk guidelines.  
- **Standard OGM** becomes **semiannual** once the 18-month window is reached (currently scheduled for August 2024).  
- **Sensitivity analysis** is not mandated for color-rating decisions but remains a best practice for scenario “what-if” insights.

### **4.3 Conclusion on OGM**  
The **OGM Plan** is **comprehensive** and adheres to standard Model Risk Management (MRM) practices. The **metrics, thresholds, and escalation** steps align with industry norms for monitoring credit underwriting models.

No additional remediation is required at this time. If a “Red” threshold breach occurs in the next OGM cycle, a **root cause analysis** (and potential recalibration) should follow the action plan in Section 9.1.6.2.

## **5. Validation Review Conclusion**

Based on this review of the **MOD13512 OGM Plan**:

1. The OGM approach is **Fit for Use with Caution**, consistent with Tier 1 model governance.  
2. The plan addresses **discrimination (AUC, KS)**, **stability (PSI)**, **benchmarking** (when feasible), **data controls**, **escalation**, and **governance**.  
3. **Sensitivity analysis** is documented and can provide additional insight but does **not** directly affect color ratings.  

No open risk items or additional enhancements are recommended beyond routine OGM checks. The next OGM report is due by **08/31/2023** (3-month early warning cycle).

> **Final Rating**: **Fit for Use with Caution**  
> **No Further Remediation** Required
