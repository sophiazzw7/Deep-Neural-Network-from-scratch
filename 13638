### **Meeting Notes – OGM Monitoring Plan & Policy Updates**  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Attendees:** [List attendees]  
**Facilitator:** [Insert name]  

#### **Key Discussion Points:**  

1. **Suspension of OGM Monitoring Plan**  
   - The OGM monitoring plan submitted in early December will be suspended as it is no longer appropriate.  
   - The team proposes that for the purposes of the OGM finding, the monitoring plan for this model should be considered out of scope.  
   - Agreement was sought from all stakeholders regarding this decision.  

2. **Qualitative Nature of the Model & Justification of Assumptions**  
   - The model is classified as qualitative and heavily reliant on expert judgment and assumptions rather than a purely quantitative approach.  
   - It was agreed that the focus should be on documenting and justifying the assumptions used in the model.  
   - Before using the model, it must be confirmed that the assumptions, such as the multiplier approach, remain appropriate.  
   - Since the model is not quantitative, its validity relies on the justification of its assumptions.  

3. **Policy & Procedure Considerations for Qualitative Models**  
   - Currently, there is no formal definition or classification of qualitative models within existing policies.  
   - As more qualitative or expert-judgment-based models emerge, there is an intent to refine policies and procedures to incorporate them as a class of models.  
   - For the OGM minimum requirements, adjustments will be made within the procedural guidelines rather than a high-level policy change, which is a more complex process.  

4. **Next Steps & Action Items**  
   - **Submission Deadline:** The final submission is scheduled for tomorrow, pending the inclusion of control IDs and minor updates.  
   - **Model Documentation Updates:** Sophia will be contacted to ensure all necessary updates are made within the new ServiceNow system.  
   - **Policy & Procedure Updates:**  
     - The procedural update to formally recognize qualitative models is planned before June next year.  
     - Consideration will be given to either implementing a policy exception for this case or revising procedures to accommodate this type of model monitoring.  

#### **Conclusion:**  
- No additional questions were raised.  
- The primary focus remains on documenting and validating assumptions to ensure model integrity.  
- The team will proceed with updating procedures, with formal policy refinements planned for next year.  

**Meeting Adjourned.**
