## **1. Model Description (Updated)**
The **Zest ML Probability of Default Model (MOD13512)**—also referred to as the **ZestAI Obligation Risk Score (ZORS)**—is a vended machine-learning (ML) model used in the **LightStream (LS)** business. It was jointly authored by **Truist Financial Services**, including the **Retail Quantitative Credit Risk Analytics (ROCRA)** team and **LightStream Analytics**, in collaboration with **Zest AI**, the principal developer. 

**Document Version**: 1.0.20250124 (superseding all previous versions)

### **Purpose and Scope**
- The ZORS model is a **credit risk model** primarily designed for **decisioning credit applications** and **rating** the LightStream consumer loan portfolio, which specializes in **unsecured installment loans**.  
- Specifically, **ZORS** is an **account origination** model that predicts the probability an applicant will become **60+ days past due (DPD)** within **18 months** of origination.  
- **Four Segments** (Auto, Debt Consolidation, Home Improvement, and Other) each utilize a custom ML model. 

### **Development and Methodology**
- **Development Date**: Q4 2022  
- **Data Coverage**: The model was built using **all applications** (booked and rejected). For rejected applications, a **proxy trade** approach was used to assign performance outcomes (reject inference).  
- **ML Technique**: Zest AI employed a gradient-boosted framework (XGBoost) with proprietary feature engineering. Because of Zest AI’s proprietary methods, only limited methodological detail is disclosed.  
- **Model Documentation**: This development evidence includes the business problem, data sources, modeling techniques, and both technical and economic analyses. It also supports LightStream’s compliance requirements and decision-making for consumer installment loans.

### **Implementation and Use**
- **Implementation Date**: October 26, 2022  
- **Model Output**: ZORS (ZestAI Obligation Risk Score) used by LightStream underwriting to approve or decline applications.  
- **Business Objective**: Provide refined underwriting capabilities by assigning risk-based cutoff scores that align with LS’s objectives (e.g., maintaining default rates, loan volume, or margin targets).  
- **Production Volume (2023 Estimate)**: \$2.79 billion

### **Upstream/Downstream Relationships**
- **Upstream**: LightStream Data Warehouse & Application Data  
- **Downstream**: MOD13627 (Adverse Action Reason Codes), which uses ZORS outputs to derive top reason codes for declined applications  

Zest AI’s proprietary development process means only partial visibility into feature engineering and modeling details is provided. However, the co-authored documentation ensures that **regulatory and risk management expectations**—including robust testing and validation—are met.
