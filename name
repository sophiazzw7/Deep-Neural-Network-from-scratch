Subject: Request for Rough Implementation Date Estimate

Hi Tony and Yong,

I hope youâ€™re both doing well. Jun mentioned that you might have the most accurate information regarding the implementation date for the new models. Could you please provide a rough estimate on when these models are expected to go live? 

Your guidance will help us plan and allocate resources accordingly. Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Best regards,
