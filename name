Hi Alex,

I’ve started prepping for the presentation. I’ve updated the local setup slides to reflect the Python coding workflow in PyCharm, and I’ll include a brief explanation of how Pagemaker aligns with the Anaconda/Python work we’ve been doing. Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to incorporate. I look forward to talking next Monday.

Best,
Sophia
