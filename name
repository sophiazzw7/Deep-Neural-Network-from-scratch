MOD12005 is being expanded to the small commercial population, but I noticed Somer’s D is only 0.03 in one segment, which suggests the model isn’t doing better than random there.

I’m thinking of putting a temporary hold on use in that segment. Mike Young and Susan Yan mentioned you were part of the peer review group when this was discussed, so I wanted to get your thoughts.
