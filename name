Subject: Sub-Issue on Data Thinness – Recommended 3-Year Monitoring Window

Hi [Boss Name],

Given our discussion on the limited bads (183) in the expanded TBE dataset, the developers and I agree semi-annual monitoring is appropriate until enough defaults accrue. Because the model needs a 24-month performance window plus about a year to accumulate additional data, we expect a full three-year period for sufficient samples.

Would you recommend creating a sub-issue in our validation review to capture this data-thinness risk and assigning it a three-year due date for re-evaluation? Or is there another approach you’d prefer?

Thanks,
