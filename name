Thanks for the update — if `KS` is showing **0** from the manual method, then that means the model isn’t separating goods and bads *at all* in the **booked data** — or something went wrong in the data flow.

Let’s debug this quickly — here’s what to check.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Debug Checklist

### 🔍 1. Confirm you have **both goods and bads** in `booked_data`

Run:

```sas
proc freq data=booked_data;
   tables bad60_24m / missing;
run;
```

✅ Expected:
- You should see **at least one 1 and one 0**
- If all values are 0 (or 1), **KS will be 0** — there's no separation to calculate

---

### 🔍 2. Confirm scores aren’t constant or missing

Run:

```sas
proc means data=booked_data n nmiss min max;
   var pts_ttl;
run;
```

✅ You want:
- `nmiss = 0`
- `min < max` — i.e. score varies

If all values of `pts_ttl` are the same, **KS will be 0** (no ranking possible)

---

### 🔍 3. View part of the `ks_curve` to check calculations

```sas
proc print data=ks_curve(obs=10);
   var pts_ttl bad60_24m wt cum_bad cum_good pct_cum_bad pct_cum_good ks_val;
run;
```

✅ You should see:
- `ks_val` gradually changing
- `pct_cum_bad` and `pct_cum_good` progressing from 0 to 1

If **everything is flat**, then something went wrong with cumulative logic.

---

### 🔧 If All Else Fails: Add Debug Print

Add this before the `data ks_curve` step:

```sas
%put NOTE: Total bad weight = &total_bad;
%put NOTE: Total good weight = &total_good;
```

If either value prints as 0, then `bad60_24m` is **all 1s or all 0s** after filtering.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

> **If you have very few bads** (say <10 in the booked population), the KS curve may be too flat to matter.  
> But KS = 0 is a red flag — it either means:
> - No discrimination
> - Or your target variable is misaligned

💡 Want me to give you a full example using dummy data so you can validate your logic side-by-side? Or send a sanitized output of your `proc freq` and `proc means`, and I’ll spot it.
