**Subject:** Follow-Up on Validation VLT0010827 and Teammate Inquiry

Hi [Boss’s Name],  
I wanted to follow up on Validation VLT0010827, which I completed and sent for your review on April 2. I recently received an email from [Teammate’s Name] asking about the status, as there appears to be an Archer issue related to this validation.

In the report, I recommended closing Finding F_19735 and marking the review complete. However, since I haven’t heard back and understand you may still be reviewing it, I didn’t want to respond with a definitive answer before getting your input.

Would you mind letting me know your thoughts when you have a chance? I’ll hold off on replying until then.

Best,  
Phoebe

Would you like to soften the tone further or keep it as is?
