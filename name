Sure — here’s a **brief summary you can tell your boss**:

---

**OGM Feasibility for the Model**

* **Traditional OGM (e.g., backtesting/stability)** doesn’t apply because:

  * Forecasts are qualitative and SME-driven, not model-calculated.
  * Losses are rare and volatile — no meaningful “true” to compare against.
  * Forecasts reflect judgment, not data inputs — no statistical output to test.

---

**Proposed OGM Approach (Qualitative OGM):**

1. **Year-over-Year Stability Checks**

   * Flag large changes in total/BU-level forecasts (e.g., >25%).
   * Require SME explanations for major shifts.

2. **Trigger-Based Monitoring**

   * Watch for major changes in risk profile or unchanged forecasts despite events.

3. **Process Quality Review**

   * Ensure SME engagement, rationale documentation, central oversight are complete.

4. **Narrative Backtest (Post-Period Review)**

   * After the year, assess if realized losses were in line with risk drivers forecasted — not quantitatively, but judgmentally.
