Step 1: Intro to Python (Fundamentals) - Goal: Learn Python basics — variables, data types, loops, functions, and conditionals. - Purpose: Build a foundation so you can read/write analysis code. - Fit for us: Ensures everyone understands syntax before working with datasets.
Step 2: Data Analysis & Visualization with pandas + Matplotlib - Goal: Apply Python to real validation tasks. - Covers: Data loading, cleaning (missing/duplicate handling), slicing, aggregation. - Visualization: Histograms, bar charts, heatmaps. - Fit for us: Directly maps to our Data Quality and Data Appropriateness checks.
Path: Step 1 builds your language skills → Step 2 applies them to real model validation workflows.
