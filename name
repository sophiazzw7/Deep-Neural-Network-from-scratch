**Subject:** Follow-up on Compensating Controls and ZORS Usage in Decisioning

Hi Vera,

Thank you for the detailed information shared earlier regarding the recently approved policy adjustments and the FICO/DTI matrix.

As part of our ongoing review, we would appreciate further clarification on the following points:

1. **Interaction between ZORS and FICO/DTI in underwriting:**
   We understand from the MDD that ZORS is used in conjunction with the FICO score and other policy rules, with thresholds like 650+ for auto-approval and 630–649 triggering manual review. Could you help us better understand how ZORS and the FICO/DTI matrix interact operationally during credit decisioning? For example:

   * Are both ZORS and FICO/DTI conditions required to be met simultaneously for approval?
   * If there is a conflict between ZORS and FICO/DTI outcomes (e.g., ZORS passes but FICO/DTI does not), which takes precedence?
   * Are there any override conditions based on one score but not the other?

2. **Coverage for other consumer-purpose segments:**
   While we appreciate the targeted controls for Home Improvement loans, we also observed declining discrimination metrics (particularly KS) in the *Other* and *Debt Consolidation* segments. Are there plans to extend compensating controls to these segments during the interim period prior to model rebuild completion?

Please let us know if a short call would be helpful to walk through these items together. We are happy to assist in reviewing any draft documentation or implementation plans.

Best regards,

Model Risk Oversight (MRO)
