Thank You and Looking Ahead
Hi [Boss’s Name],

I hope you’re enjoying your time off! CJ announced my promotion at the all-hands yesterday, and I wanted to take a moment to thank you. I really appreciate your support throughout this process.

When you're back, I’d love to connect to better understand any new responsibilities, expectations, or next steps.

Looking forward to catching up soon!

Best,
[Your Name]
