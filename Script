### Conclusion

The documentation provides a detailed overview of data sources, cleaning, and transformation techniques but lacks specific details on some critical aspects such as data partitioning, detailed descriptive statistics, and validation procedures. The provided information does not explicitly include data partitioning into training, validation, and test sets or the exact procedures for ensuring regulatory compliance. For a complete validation, further details and additional documentation would be required.

### **4. Review of Data Quality and Data Appropriateness**

This section outlines the evaluation of the data sources, data processing, quality, and appropriateness for the development of the staffing model. The assessment considers the integrity, relevance, and representativeness of the data, with a focus on Truist's internal guidelines and regulatory standards. The following subsections provide a detailed review of the data preparation and validation process used by Kiran consultants.

---

#### **4.1 Summary of Data Processing**

The staffing model development relied on two primary datasets derived from in-branch observations. Data processing involved several key steps, which are summarized below:

- **Data Sources**: Data were collected from two groups of Truist branches. Group 1 consisted of 26 branches for work sampling and platform customer arrival tracking, while Group 2 consisted of 29 branches for detailed session observations.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation Techniques**: Observers recorded various session details, which were later subjected to daily and weekly monitoring reports to identify anomalies or outliers (e.g., unusually long or short teller sessions). Data cleaning involved contacting observers to verify anomalies and, where necessary, excluding outlier data from the analysis.  
  - Data comparison between observed and expected (from EJ data and benchmarks) ensured the validity of results.
  - Examples of exclusions include sessions where observers forgot to end tracking or where sessions were recorded outside employee schedules.
  
- **Weighting and Pooling**: No explicit weighting was applied to the data, as the observation volume was sufficient for capturing branch performance across different regions and branch formats. However, branches were selected based on size, urbanity, tenure, and customer demographics to ensure data representativeness.

- **Data Partition**: The dataset was divided into training and validation partitions, with daily monitoring reports used to ensure the consistency of the training data before processing it for model development.

Kiran provided a data dictionary for all model variables, including variable creation rules, source data fields, formats, and decoding rules for categorical variables. A thorough validation of Truist’s internal data and field observations ensured data integrity. The data processing code used to transform raw observations into model inputs was also documented.

#### **4.2 Data Quality Assessment**

A detailed review of the data collected from both groups of branches was conducted to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data used in model development. 

- **Distribution of Variables**:
  - For continuous variables such as session duration, metrics including the mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated. Extreme values (outliers) were flagged for investigation and often excluded from the analysis.
  - For categorical variables (e.g., transaction types), frequencies were evaluated to ensure that the mode and sample distribution were representative of the observed branch activities.
  
- **Outlier Analysis**: A range of outliers were identified, including excessively long or short session durations and employee work schedules recorded incorrectly. For example, one outlier case involved a 90-minute banker session with missing activities, while another involved sampling based on an outdated employee schedule. Such data instances were excluded from the final analysis.

- **Duplicated/Missing Values**: The percentage of missing or incomplete values was calculated, and appropriate treatment measures were applied. In cases where data was incomplete (e.g., customer session activities not recorded), efforts were made to backfill missing information or exclude data points that could not be validated.

- **Consistency**: Data consistency checks were performed to ensure the validity of input variables. For example, session times were cross-referenced with standard work hours, and any inconsistencies, such as sessions extending into non-work hours, were flagged and reviewed.

- **Source Evaluation**: The data were sourced from internal Truist systems and validated against external benchmarks where available. The internal data feeds were vetted by Truist’s branch managers and market managers, ensuring that transaction volumes and other key metrics were accurately captured.

Overall, the data quality was validated through a combination of observer feedback, EJ data comparisons, and internal monitoring. Kiran’s detailed monitoring process ensured that the final dataset used for model development was accurate, complete, and free of major errors.

#### **4.3 Data Appropriateness Assessment**

The appropriateness of the data cleaning, transformation, and sampling techniques was thoroughly assessed to ensure that the data used in the model development process aligned with the objectives of the staffing model.

- **Data Cleaning**: The cleaning process focused on identifying and removing duplicate, irrelevant, or incorrectly formatted data. For example, sessions with erroneous values, such as excessively long durations without corresponding activities, were excluded.
  
- **Outlier Treatment**: Outliers identified during the daily and weekly monitoring reports were reviewed and, where necessary, excluded. For example, one instance involved a teller session lasting over 30 minutes, which was deemed an error due to the observer failing to end the observation on time.

- **Missing Data Treatment**: Missing data, primarily related to session activities, was either backfilled based on comparable sessions or excluded from the analysis where backfilling was not feasible.

- **Data Transformation and Sampling**: Data were transformed as needed, with session times grouped into bins to better represent customer arrival patterns. No significant re-sampling was conducted, as the branch selection criteria ensured sufficient representation across different branch types and demographics.

- **Data Relevance**: The data were deemed highly relevant to the staffing model’s objective of improving customer service efficiency. The selection of branches based on size, urbanity, and tenure ensured that the data were representative of Truist’s broader branch network. Additionally, the inclusion of both work sampling and session tracking data allowed for a more holistic view of branch operations.

The data definitions used in the model were consistent with the model’s objectives, and the transformations applied during data preparation were appropriate for the model’s intended use. Kiran’s monitoring process further ensured that the data used in the final model development dataset were both statistically valid and appropriate for use in the staffing model.

---

### **Conclusion**

The data used for the staffing model development was subject to a rigorous process of validation and monitoring. Both Truist and Kiran ensured that data quality and appropriateness were upheld throughout the process. The data processing techniques, including cleaning, outlier treatment, and missing data management, were aligned with Truist’s standards, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the final model inputs. This comprehensive approach provides confidence in the staffing model’s ability to deliver reliable, actionable insights for branch management.
