Clarification on Usage and Human Interaction in MOD13638
I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been reviewing the documentation for MODxxx and noticed that "the model's final result is subject to subsequent review and challenge by the Capital Committee." Given our recent experience with MOD13616—where we reclassified it from a champion model to an R&D model due to its role as an enhancement rather than a standalone decision-making tool—I’d like to seek some clarification on MODxxx.

For MOD13616, in cases of disagreement between the model's estimate and the SME’s decision, our team prioritizes the SME's judgment over the model's output. With this in mind, we’re evaluating whether MOD13638 might warrant a similar reclassification.

Could you please provide clarity on the following points:
1. To what extent is MOD13638 subject to human interaction or intervention, particularly in terms of review or adjustment of its outputs?
2. Are there scenarios where SME or committee input might override the model’s estimates?
3. Do you see any parallels between the usage of MOD13638 and MOD13616 that could influence a potential reclassification of MOD13638 as an R&D model?

Your insights will be crucial in ensuring we accurately understand the operational role and classification of MOD13638.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
