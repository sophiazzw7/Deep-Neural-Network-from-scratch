Clarification Questions and Pre-Meeting Discussion on Model Setup

Hi [Developer's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm looking forward to our meeting tomorrow to delve into the model data structure. To ensure our discussion is as productive as possible, I have a few clarification questions regarding the model setup. If we could touch base on these before we dive into the data structure, it would be immensely helpful. Here are the questions:

1. **Exposure Marginal Distribution:**
   - In the MCMC process, the first step involves drawing Exposure Xi from the exposure marginal distribution. Could you specify which distribution is used for this purpose?

   - In the second step, where Occurrence is sampled from each Exposure, the Occurrence follows a binomial distribution. Could you shed light on how the probability (p) for the binomial distribution is determined?

   - Moving to the third step, the Expected Loss is sampled from each occurrence. Could you clarify which distribution governs the Expected Loss?

2. **Model Testing:**
   - The white paper mentions various model testing approaches such as validation of the transposition document, validation of the quantification document, back testing, sensitivity analysis, and benchmarking. However, I couldn't find specific details about model testing in the Model Development Documentation. Could you provide some insights or direct me to the relevant section?

3. **Scenario Testing:**
   - Scenario testing is noted as a model testing method to assess performance over a wide range of inputs, including extreme values. I couldn't locate specific testing results for this. Could you share any available information on scenario testing outcomes?

4. **Identification of Current Scenarios:**
   - Understanding how current scenarios are identified would be beneficial. My understanding is that scenarios are determined following a loss analysis and a set threshold. Could you provide more details on this process, such as how the threshold is decided?

5. **Model Inputs to mSTAR Software:**
   - Lastly, I'm curious about the specific model inputs to the mSTAR software. Could you share some insights into this aspect?

Your insights on these questions will contribute significantly to our discussion. I appreciate your time and assistance in clarifying these details before our meeting.

Looking forward to our discussion tomorrow.

Best regards,
