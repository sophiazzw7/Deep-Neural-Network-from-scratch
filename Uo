.4. Precision-Recall Curve

Precision-Recall Curve: The precision-recall curve, which is especially useful for imbalanced datasets like ours, indicates that precision drops sharply as recall increases. This is expected given the imbalance in the dataset.

Average Precision Score: The average precision score is 0.046, summarizing the precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precisions achieved at each threshold.

4.5. Confusion Matrix and Derived Metrics

Metric	Value
Accuracy	0.947
Precision	0.041
Recall	0.569
F1 Score	0.077
Specificity	0.947
Note: The metrics are calculated with a threshold set to 0.028 based on the distribution of y_true and y_pred.

5. Insights and Recommendations
Observations:

The funding rate is high across different application types and loan purposes, indicating that the model's predictions align well with actual funding decisions.
The ROC AUC and Gini coefficients suggest moderate model performance. There is potential for significant improvement in these areas.
The low precision indicates that the model produces many false positives, which can be problematic in a real-world scenario. This is evident from the sharp drop in the precision-recall curve.
The recall rate is relatively high, meaning the model captures a good portion of the actual defaults but at the cost of a high false positive rate.
Concerns:

Model Stability: The moderate values of the ROC AUC and Gini coefficients suggest that the model might not be stable across different datasets or over time. This requires further investigation and potentially more robust model training.
Performance on Imbalanced Data: The model struggles with precision due to the imbalance in the dataset. While recall is acceptable, the precision is too low, indicating many false positives. This imbalance needs addressing through techniques like SMOTE or adjusting the classification threshold.
Threshold Setting: The current threshold of 0.028, based on the distribution of predictions, results in low precision. A thorough analysis to find an optimal threshold that balances precision and recall is necessary.
Recommendations:

Threshold Adjustment: Fine-tune the classification threshold to achieve a better balance between precision and recall.
Data Balancing: Implement techniques such as SMOTE to handle imbalanced data, ensuring the model captures more positive samples.
Model Retraining: Periodically retrain the model with updated data to adapt to changing patterns and maintain performance.
Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations that might improve model performance.
Regular Monitoring: Establish a routine for monitoring model performance metrics over time to detect and address any deterioration in model quality.
6. Clarifications and Actions
During the recent meeting with the model development team, it was clarified that the development AUC was calculated on a funded + unfunded population, while the OGM AUC was based only on the funded population. This discrepancy in the population basis led to an apples-to-oranges comparison. As a result, the team agreed on the necessity of a recalibration plan to incorporate both funded and unfunded performance metrics in future OGM reports. The developer is tasked with proposing a new OGM plan to address this issue.




Conclusion
The loan default prediction model demonstrates moderate performance metrics, particularly in terms of funding rates. However, adjustments in threshold settings and handling data imbalance are crucial to enhancing precision and recall. Continuous monitoring and model retraining are recommended to ensure sustained performance. Additionally, a recalibration plan to include both funded and unfunded performance metrics is essential for accurate model evaluation.

Note on Model Monitoring
It is important to highlight that monitoring only AUC might not capture the full performance of the model. Including precision and recall in the monitoring process provides a more comprehensive view of the model's ability to correctly identify defaults and avoid false positives.
