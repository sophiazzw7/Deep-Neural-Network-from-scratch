The assumption that "the past will reflect the future" is a common one in many modeling contexts, particularly when the models are developed using historical data. This assumption posits that the distribution of input variables during the development phase will be similar to the distribution of those variables in the production environment. Here are some considerations to determine if this assumption makes sense:

### When the Assumption is Valid:

1. **Stable Environment**: If the environment in which the model operates is relatively stable, meaning there are no significant changes in the underlying data generation process, this assumption can hold. Examples include well-established industries with stable consumer behavior or economic conditions.

2. **Short Time Horizons**: If the time between the development and deployment of the model is short, the likelihood that the input variable distributions will remain similar is higher. 

3. **Regulated or Controlled Systems**: In systems with strong regulatory controls or consistent operational procedures, changes in the data patterns might be minimal, supporting the assumption.

### When the Assumption May Not Hold:

1. **Dynamic Environments**: In rapidly changing environments, such as technology, finance, or consumer markets, past data might not be a reliable indicator of future patterns. Changes in regulations, market conditions, or consumer behavior can significantly alter input variable distributions.

2. **External Shocks**: Events such as economic recessions, pandemics, or natural disasters can drastically change the distribution of input variables. Models developed before such events may not perform well post-event without adjustments.

3. **Data Drift**: Over time, the properties of the data can change (a phenomenon known as data drift). This can be due to changes in the underlying processes generating the data or changes in the way data is collected or processed.

### Mitigating the Risks:

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Implementing continuous monitoring of input variable distributions in production can help detect deviations from the development data distributions. This allows for timely updates or retraining of the model.

2. **Adaptive Models**: Developing models that can adapt to changing data distributions can help maintain performance. Techniques like online learning or periodically retraining the model with recent data can be beneficial.

3. **Validation with Recent Data**: Including more recent data in the validation set during model development can provide a better indication of future performance. Additionally, using techniques like cross-validation with time-series data can help account for temporal changes.

4. **Scenario Analysis**: Performing scenario analysis and stress testing the model with different data distributions can help understand how robust the model is to changes in the input variables.

### Conclusion:

While the assumption that the past will reflect the future can be a reasonable starting point, it is essential to critically evaluate its validity based on the specific context and environment in which the model operates. Implementing strategies to monitor and adapt to changing data distributions can help mitigate the risks associated with this assumption.
