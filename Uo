urrently, in OGM reports, we only report funded loans. Therefore, I calculated AUCs specifically for funded loans. Here's what I did: I segmented the data into four categoriesâ€”auto, consolidation, home improvement, and others. For each segment, I selected loan samples and computed their AUCs using XGBoost, tracking 1000 samples per segment to account for funding variations.

From these 1000 samples, I calculated the standard deviation and established thresholds at one, two, three, and four standard deviations. Using the statistical "68-95-99.7 rule," where three standard deviations cover nearly 100% of the data, I set the lower threshold at this limit for grading. The threshold for full coverage (100%) was set at four standard deviations.
