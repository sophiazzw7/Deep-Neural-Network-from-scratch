 Was saying that MC A was submitted to wrong email bugs. And uh so, but now it's corrected and it's in progress. So we need to reflect the fact that we recognize the need to rate uh dual score matrices as models. OK. OK. OK. So I'll mention that we have submitted MC A um for dual metrics and we are aware that they have to be identified as model in my validation report. Is that correct on the standing Alex? That that's correct. That's correct. So it's, it's not a finding, but we need to highlight that fact.


### Meeting Notes

**Subject**: Discussion on Historical Sales Data and Model Fit-for-Use

**Participants**: 
- Alex
- Other Team Members

**Key Points Discussed**:

1. **MC A Submission and Dual Score Matrices**:
   - Corrected initial error in submission email.
   - Acknowledgment of the need to rate dual score matrices as models in the validation report.
   - Highlight the necessity without it being considered a finding.

2. **Sales Strategy Post-Merger**:
   - Historical BB&T and SunTrust branches were selling live stream products.
   - Post-merger, live stream products were pulled from branches to avoid cannibalizing business.
   - Historical SunTrust clients can still apply for live stream products online.

3. **Current Sales Channels**:
   - Transition from branch sales to digital channels and call centers.
   - Current in-branch sales focus on secured loan products.
   - Future plan to reintroduce live stream products in branches, replacing current unsecured loans.

4. **Fit-for-Use Evaluation**:
   - Expansion in the user population requires fit-for-use evaluation.
   - The fit-for-use review will be necessary before launching the email campaign.
   - Timeline for system completion by end of the year, with sales starting next year.

5. **Performance Metrics and Data Evaluation**:
   - Use of OGM (Operational Gross Margin) data to evaluate performance.
   - Review of risk and limitations, model use, and assumptions.
   - Additional testing on OGM data, variable selections, and performance metrics.

6. **Data Certification**:
   - Discussed the need for data certification, especially for external data from TransUnion.
   - Certification could involve multiple forms and examples will be shared for clarification.
   - Ensuring data integrity for both internal and external data sets.

7. **Action Items**:
   - Submit MC A form and perform testing on DE model.
   - Evaluate model assumptions and performance using OGM data.
   - Review raw data and OGM codes.
   - Obtain examples of data certification for internal review.

8. **Additional Points**:
   - Ensuring badge statuses are tracked for all team members.
   - Potential parallel processing for green card advertisement and labor certification.

**Next Steps**:
- Alex to submit the necessary forms and perform the required testing.
- Review the OGM data and provide performance metrics.
- Gather and review examples of data certification.
- Keep track of any updates in policies and procedures.

**Thank you for the productive discussion and cooperation. Please let me know if there are any further questions or details needed.**

### Meeting Notes

**Subject**: Discussion on TransUnion Data Verification and Certification

**Participants**: 
- Alex
- Other Team Members

**Key Points Discussed**:

1. **Verification of Application Data**:
   - Emphasis on verifying the overall distribution of acquisition quarters, number of applications, and PII format.
   - Certification of internal data used to send to TransUnion for integrity evidence.

2. **Clarification on Certification Process**:
   - Lack of a clear definition of certification within the team.
   - Focus on tracing the custody of data and ensuring data quality at each transfer point.
   - Aim to document the verification and data flow processes.

3. **Data Integrity Checks**:
   - Expectation of reasonable checks for data quality, acknowledging that 100% match is not expected.
   - Manual involvement in the process, with ultimate responsibility for data integrity lying with the team.

4. **Data Handling by TransUnion and Zest**:
   - Trade line data sent directly from TransUnion to Zest without the team touching this part of the data.
   - Discussion on the possibility of getting verification or data shape checks from TransUnion to ensure data completeness.

5. **Action Items**:
   - Document the verification process and data flow performed by the team.
   - Request TransUnion for any data shape checks or distribution verification they perform upon receiving data.

6. **Additional Points**:
   - Importance of providing thorough documentation to get credit for the work done.
   - Ensuring data integrity across all data sources and maintaining evidence for it.

**Next Steps**:
- Alex to document the data verification process and share it with the team.
- Follow up with TransUnion for additional data verification evidence.
- Continue to trace and ensure data integrity throughout the data transfer process.

**Thank you for the productive discussion and cooperation. Please let me know if there are any further questions or details needed.**

### Meeting Notes

**Subject**: Data Verification and Certification Process

**Participants**: 
- Vera
- Other Team Members

**Key Points Discussed**:

1. **Data Comparison**:
   - Differences between input and output files expected.
   - Need for comparison between requested and received data.
   - Matching archives for each acquisition vintage to identify acceptable differences.

2. **Documentation Requirement**:
   - Document the data requested vs. received.
   - Provide reasons for any missing data and justify why it's acceptable.
   - Example: matching data with rationales for non-matches.

3. **Understanding Data Flow**:
   - TransUnion sends data directly to Zest without team involvement.
   - Need to clarify data flow and match checkpoints.
   - Create a detailed data process flow with checkpoints for verification.

4. **Matching and Verification**:
   - Importance of matching data counts and ensuring data quality.
   - Check data received by Zest against what was sent by TransUnion.
   - Update data flow documentation to reflect the process accurately.

5. **Handling OGM Data**:
   - Certification needed for both development data and OGM data sources.
   - OGM data as real-time production data requires a nuanced approach.
