 Was saying that MC A was submitted to wrong email bugs. And uh so, but now it's corrected and it's in progress. So we need to reflect the fact that we recognize the need to rate uh dual score matrices as models. OK. OK. OK. So I'll mention that we have submitted MC A um for dual metrics and we are aware that they have to be identified as model in my validation report. Is that correct on the standing Alex? That that's correct. That's correct. So it's, it's not a finding, but we need to highlight that fact.

### Meeting Notes

**Subject**: Discussion on TransUnion Data Verification and Certification

**Participants**: 
- Alex
- Other Team Members

**Key Points Discussed**:

1. **Verification of Application Data**:
   - Emphasis on verifying the overall distribution of acquisition quarters, number of applications, and PII format.
   - Certification of internal data used to send to TransUnion for integrity evidence.

2. **Clarification on Certification Process**:

   - Expectation of reasonable checks for data quality, acknowledging that 100% match is not expected.
   - Manual involvement in the process, with ultimate responsibility for data integrity lying with the team.

4. **Data Handling by TransUnion and Zest**:
   - Trade line data sent directly from TransUnion to Zest without the team touching this part of the data.
   - Discussion on the possibility of getting verification or data shape checks from TransUnion to ensure data completeness.

5. **Action Items**:
   - Document the verification process and data flow performed by the team.
   - Request TransUnion for any data shape checks or distribution verification they perform upon receiving data.

6. **Additional Points**:
   - Importance of providing thorough documentation to get credit for the work done.
   - Ensuring data integrity across all data sources and maintaining evidence for it.

**Next Steps**:
- Alex to document the data verification process and share it with the team.
- Follow up with TransUnion for additional data verification evidence.
- Continue to trace and ensure data integrity throughout the data transfer process.

**Thank you for the productive discussion and cooperation. Please let me know if there are any further questions or details needed.**
