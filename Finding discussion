2. **Full Data Cleaning Process**  
   **Finding:** No documentation of data cleaning, smoothing, transformations, or backfilling.  
   **Document Location:** Data-related sections of the model documentation lack this information.  
   **Missing:** Data cleaning steps, with justifications for each process (e.g., smoothing, backfilling).  
   **Procedure/Template Requirement:** The procedure mandates that all steps in the data cleaning process be documented and justified.

3. **Assessment of Data Quality**  
   **Finding:** Missing a comprehensive assessment of data quality addressing outliers, missing, corrupted, and duplicated data.  
   **Document Location:** Section 7.4 does not cover this.  
   **Missing:** An in-depth review of data quality and consistency checks is not provided.  
   **Procedure/Template Requirement:** The procedure requires a full assessment of data quality with proper treatment methodologies for anomalies.



### 4. **Evaluation of Data Sources' Reliability**  
   **Finding:** Missing a detailed evaluation of data sources' reliability, representativeness, and statistical validation of data assumptions, especially regarding the suitability of historical data.  
   **Document Location:** Data sections in the model documentation do not have sufficient details on this.  
   **Missing:** There's no validation of the reliability of historical data for future forecasting, nor any statistical validation of the assumptions.  
   **Procedure/Template Requirement:** The procedure requires that all data sources be validated for reliability, representativeness, and appropriateness for the forecasting task.

### 5. **Sampling and Partitioning Methodologies**  
   **Finding:** Documentation on sampling, re-sampling, or partitioning methodologies used is absent.

   **Document Location:** This is not present in the model development sections.  
   **Missing:** The actual code used for processing and transforming data isn't documented.  
   **Procedure/Template Requirement:** The procedure requires that any code used to manipulate or transform the data should be documented and explained.

### 7. **Compliance with Regulatory Data Requirements**  
   **Finding:** Documentation confirming that the model data complies with regulatory data requirements is missing.
