**From:** [Your Name], [Your Title/Role]  
**Subject:** Discontinuation of Back-Testing for Qualitative Operational Risk Event Types (IF, DPA, EDPM, EPWS)

**Date:** [Date]

### 1. **Purpose**
This memo formalizes the rationale for removing and discontinuing back-testing analysis for the four qualitative Operational Risk event types—Internal Fraud (IF), Damage to Physical Assets (DPA), Execution, Delivery, and Process Management (EDPM), and Employment Practices and Workplace Safety (EPWS)—under the MOD13638 Operational Loss Forecast Model. It further clarifies that no back-testing will be required going forward, in alignment with both Model Development and Model Risk Oversight (MRO) perspectives.

### 2. **Background**
- **Model Overview**  
  The MOD13638 model estimates potential operational risk losses for Truist under various macroeconomic scenarios, primarily supporting CCAR and DFAST submissions. Historically, the model included six Basel-defined event types—IF, EF, CPBP, EPWS, EDPM, and DPA—where EF (External Fraud) and CPBP (Clients, Products, and Business Practices) recently shifted to a purely qualitative approach, and IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS have always used a frequency-times-severity approach grounded in internal operational loss data.  

- **Prior Back-Testing Requirement**  
  Previous methodologies attempted to incorporate macroeconomic variables (e.g., negative binomial regression) and were subject to quantitative back-testing where feasible. Over time, however, these relationships proved weak or inconsistent, rendering quantitative performance metrics (including back-testing) of limited value for the EF and CPBP event types.  

- **Shift to Qualitative Approach**  
  As documented in recent communications, EF and CPBP fully transitioned to a qualitative approach due to weak statistical correlations with external factors. The remaining four event types (IF, DPA, EDPM, EPWS) rely on rolling 9-quarter data and multiplier-based methods. While these elements are partly data-driven, the emphasis is on professional judgment for stress multipliers, rather than predictive economic models.

### 3. **Rationale for Discontinuing Back-Testing**
1. **Qualitative Nature of the Approach**  
   - The four event types in question do not rely on macroeconomic predictive variables, but instead use recent internal loss data with expert judgment-based stress multipliers. These multipliers are determined by comparing rolling data to historical averages.  
   - Because they are not based on statistical regression outputs, there are no meaningful “model estimates” to test against actuals in a predictive sense. As a result, back-testing does not offer actionable or reliable performance insights.

2. **Lack of Historical Predictiveness**  
   - Operational risk losses (e.g., fraud, process errors, workplace safety incidents) often involve idiosyncratic drivers that do not correlate well with economic cycles.  
   - Both MRO and model developers noted that purely historical data for these events is not necessarily indicative of future losses, thus any back-testing metrics would be misleading or inconclusive.

3. **Absence of Formal Tolerance Thresholds**  
   - In a purely qualitative framework, there are no definable thresholds or tolerance limits that would “invalidate” or formally trigger recalibration of multipliers.  
   - Without quantitative benchmarks, back-testing results would lack a clear acceptance criterion and provide no actionable feedback loop for model refinement.

4. **Alignment Among Stakeholders**  
   - Internal communications confirm that MRO, Model Development, GCO, and TAS are aligned that back-testing does not yield value under the current qualitative approaches.  
   - The model performance section containing back-testing will be removed from the Model Development Document (MDD), per the updated MRO policy and procedures.

### 4. **Conclusion and Next Steps**
- **Conclusion**  
  Given the qualitative nature and idiosyncratic risk drivers for IF, DPA, EDPM, and EPWS event types, back-testing does not add analytical value and will be discontinued. All stakeholders, including MRO, Model Development, and GCO, agree that no back-testing requirement remains relevant for these event types going forward.

- **Next Steps**  
  - **Update MDD**: Remove the back-testing section for these qualitative event types, clarifying that performance assessments will rely on expert judgment, qualitative reviews, and ongoing monitoring rather than quantitative back-tests.  
  - **Communicate to Governance Committees**: Provide a summary of this change to ensure all parties understand the revised approach and rationale.  
  - **Maintain Ongoing Monitoring**: Although formal back-testing will not be performed, periodic reviews of operational loss data trends will continue to ensure reasonableness and timely identification of anomalies.

Please let me know if there are any questions or further clarifications needed.
