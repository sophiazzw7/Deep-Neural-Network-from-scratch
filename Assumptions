### **4.1 Summary of Data Processing**

This section provides a summary of the process used to develop the model dataset, identifying the steps taken and documenting any gaps or missing information.

#### **Data Sources and Extraction**
The data sources include:
- **BB&T PC Teller System** and **BST Enterprise Teller System** for teller transactions.
- **BB&T Client Central**, **BST CLP**, and **EdgeSell** for platform sales and service data.

These sources are mentioned as the basis for producing forecasts related to transactions and client-facing activities. However, **no explicit documentation** on the data extraction process itself has been provided, raising concerns about the transparency of the extraction phase.

#### **Data Cleaning and Transformation Techniques**
- **Cleaning**: Irrelevant transactions, such as night deposits, were excluded from the dataset.
- **Transformation**: Transactions were mapped to forecast and time standard groups, and product sales were similarly mapped. These processes are described at a high level but **lack specific details** or empirical support for the data cleaning methods used, such as criteria for exclusion or backfilling data.

#### **Data Dictionary and Variable Descriptions**
From the images you provided, there is **no explicit mention** of a comprehensive **data dictionary** with all the required details (i.e., descriptions for all model variables, variable creation rules, source data fields, format, decoding rules for categorical variables, or basic descriptive statistics).

However, some relevant pieces of information about the **source data fields** and **variable descriptions** are mentioned:
- **Source Data Fields & Descriptions**: Several files have columns and descriptions, including:
  - **Teller_Transactions_yymmdd.txt**: Fields like "Cost Center ID," "Transaction Code," "Transaction Amount."
  - **DEP_sales_transaction_yymmdd.txt**: Fields like "Account Type," "Product Sale Date," "Product Code."
  - **BRANCH_CAPTURE_yymmdd_yymmdd.txt**: Fields like "Teller ID," "Deposit ID," "Item ID."
  - **Client Central yymmdd.txt**: Fields like "User ID," "Client Segment," "Service Transaction Type."

While these fields are functionally described, there is **no comprehensive data dictionary** that includes formats, units, or detailed decoding rules for categorical variables.

#### **Variable Creation Rules**
Some mention of variable creation exists, such as:
- **Mapping transactions** to Property IDs, Forecast Groups, and Time Standard Groups.
- **Categorical variables** like "Transaction Code" and "Service Type" are referenced.

However, there is **no full description of the rules** used to create variables, nor how categorical variables were decoded or treated.

#### **Missing Descriptive Statistics**
The documentation provided does **not include any descriptive statistics** (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for the model variables, which is a critical element for assessing data distribution and integrity.

#### **Data Processing Rules**
While data processing steps, such as filtering out irrelevant transactions and mapping to forecast groups, are described, **no detailed documentation** of the empirical support behind these steps is available. There is also **no mention of how missing or backfilled data values** were handled.

#### **Analyses Supporting Data Appropriateness**
There is **no evidence** of formal analyses supporting the appropriateness of the final model inputs. While semi-annual reviews are mentioned, no detailed analysis is provided to empirically justify the choice of input data.

#### **Compliance with Regulatory Requirements**
There is **no specific documentation** provided that confirms compliance with regulatory data requirements, which is an important omission given the regulatory landscape.

#### **Code Documentation**
No code used to process the source data into intermediate and final datasets has been documented, which hinders reproducibility and transparency in the data preparation phase.

### **Summary of Missing Elements**
- **Comprehensive data dictionary** with variable descriptions, units, decoding rules, and descriptive statistics.
- **Detailed empirical support** for data cleaning, handling missing or backfilled data, and variable creation rules.
- **Formal analyses** to support the appropriateness of the final model inputs.
- **Documentation of compliance** with regulatory data standards.
- **Code used** for data processing.

Without these key elements, the model development process lacks the necessary transparency and rigor for full validation.


Here's the updated section of your model validation report incorporating the new information and conclusions:

**4.1 Summary of Data Processing**

The model development dataset was created using data collected from various sources such as teller transaction data, sales activity volumes, servicing activity volumes, and branch hierarchy attributes. The process followed includes data extraction from source systems, data cleaning to remove anomalies, and the transformation of the data into the required format for modeling. The data was also pooled and partitioned based on sampling techniques and business requirements.

The documentation provided includes the following:

- **Data Dictionary**:  
  From the images provided, there is **no explicit mention** of a comprehensive **data dictionary** that contains all necessary details such as variable descriptions, variable creation rules, source data fields used to create variables, formats, decoding rules for categorical variables, or basic descriptive statistics. While some relevant pieces of information about source data fields and variable descriptions are present (e.g., descriptions for columns in "Teller_Transactions_yymmdd.txt" and other data files), they do not fully constitute a complete data dictionary.

- **Variable Creation Rules**:  
  The documentation mentions mapping transactions to Property IDs and creating Forecast Groups and Time Standard Groups, but it lacks specific rules for how these variables were created.

- **Decoding Rules for Categorical Variables**:  
  Although there are categorical variables like "Transaction Code" and "Service Type," the documentation does not include decoding rules for these variables.

- **Basic Descriptive Statistics**:  
  There is no mention of descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for the model variables in the documentation provided.

- **Missing or Backfilled Data**:  
  The table (Table 1-6-6: Data sources for inputs to the staffing model) shows that all key data inputs (teller transaction data, sales activity volumes, servicing activity volumes, and branch hierarchy attributes) have been reviewed for missing fields, and it is explicitly stated that **no missing fields** are present. This satisfies the requirement for ensuring data completeness.

---

### Conclusion:

- The provided documentation satisfies the requirement regarding **missing data**, as the table explicitly indicates that there are no missing fields in any of the input data sources.
  
- However, the lack of a comprehensive **data dictionary** and detailed **descriptive statistics** for the model inputs means that certain essential elements for validation are still missing. 

- The absence of detailed **variable creation rules** and **decoding rules for categorical variables** leaves gaps in understanding how the final model development dataset was derived.
