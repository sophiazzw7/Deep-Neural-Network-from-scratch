Below is a draft explanation covering each standard validation or analysis technique—back-testing, benchmarking, sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and stress testing—and why each does not apply to these six event types (EF, CPBP, IF, DPA, EPWS, and EDPM) under the current qualitative framework.

### **Why Standard Validation/Analysis Techniques Do Not Apply**

1. **Back-Testing**  
   - **Nature of the Methods**: All six event types now rely on a qualitative or simplified multiplier-based approach derived primarily from recent internal loss data rather than econometric or regression-based forecasts.  
   - **No Predictive Output**: Because there is no model-driven projection of future losses, there is no set of predictions to compare against actual outcomes.  
   - **No Defined Performance Thresholds**: In a purely qualitative framework, thresholds or statistical confidence intervals for validation do not exist. Hence, performing back-tests (comparing predictions vs. actuals) adds no meaningful insight.

2. **Benchmarking**  
   - **Lack of Comparable External Data**: Operational risk losses in these event types often stem from idiosyncratic internal events (fraud, process failures, internal governance issues, etc.) that do not have robust, standardized external benchmarks.  
   - **Qualitative Assumptions**: The approach depends on expert judgment and a nine-quarter lookback of internal data rather than industry-level or peer data, making direct numerical benchmarking infeasible.  
   - **Limited Applicability**: Traditional benchmarking assumes common, comparable data across firms or risk factors, which is not available or meaningful here.

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**  
   - **No Parametric Inputs**: Sensitivity analysis typically tests how changes in model parameters (e.g., coefficients in a regression) impact outcomes. In this qualitative framework, there are no statistically estimated parameters to “shock” or vary systematically.  
   - **Fixed Multipliers**: While multipliers exist, they are derived and applied qualitatively (e.g., a stress multiplier of 3.5 for EF/CPBP). Adjusting them arbitrarily does not yield a measurable “sensitivity curve” in the same sense as a quantitative model.

4. **Scenario Analysis**  
   - **Scenario Analysis vs. Qualitative Overlays**: Traditional scenario analysis involves translating macroeconomic or thematic stress scenarios into model inputs to observe changes in outputs. For these event types, the chosen “stress factor” (multiplier) is a single qualitative overlay rather than a set of scenario-driven parameters.  
   - **Idiosyncratic Losses**: Many operational risk events are episodic and not strictly tied to macroeconomic or thematic scenarios, limiting the usefulness of scenario analysis for these segments.  
   - **No Economic-Driven Forecast**: Since the model doesn’t rely on economic indicators or scenario variables, standard scenario analyses (e.g., shifting GDP, unemployment) do not systematically change these losses.

5. **Stress Testing**  
   - **Already Embedded in the Multiplier**: The model effectively uses a simple, qualitative “stress” multiplier on top of the baseline nine-quarter average frequency and severity. This single factor represents the model’s “stress” approach, rather than a detailed stress-testing framework with multiple risk drivers.  
   - **No Granular Variables to Stress**: Because there are no regression coefficients or macroeconomic linkages, a full-fledged stress-testing exercise (manipulating inputs like interest rates, GDP, etc.) does not directly apply to the outcome of these event types.  
   - **Limitations Acknowledged**: The development team and MRO recognize that purely historical data and qualitative multipliers do not reliably predict future operational loss peaks and, thus, formal stress testing against macroeconomic shocks is not relevant.

### **Conclusion**
For EF, CPBP, IF, DPA, EPWS, and EDPM, the **qualitative, multiplier-based** approach, driven by internal operational risk data and expert judgment, **does not lend itself to standard quantitative validation methods**. There are no statistical forecasts to back-test, no external benchmarks for comparison, no parametric relationships to stress or shift under scenario analyses, and no macroeconomic linkages upon which to conduct traditional stress testing. As a result, continuing these techniques would be **misleading** or **unproductive** in assessing the effectiveness of this qualitative framework.
