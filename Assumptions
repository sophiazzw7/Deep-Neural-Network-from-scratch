**1. Assessment of the EF and CPBP Transition to a Qualitative Approach (February 2025)**  
Previously, the EF (External Fraud) and CPBP (Clients, Products, and Business Practices) forecasts were built using a negative binomial regression model with macroeconomic variables.  However, as illustrated by the large “overlay deltas” in Figures 8.1 and 8.2, the macroeconomic drivers repeatedly proved too weak to explain observed operational losses.  This led to frequent—and often substantial—Tier 2 overlays, suggesting that the quantitative model alone was not sufficiently capturing the true loss profile.  

In February 2025, EF and CPBP migrated to a qualitative methodology.  This updated approach incorporates experts’ forward-looking judgments (e.g., emerging risks or recent operational events) and historical overlays.  It is also designed to remain relevant even under tenuous macroeconomic relationships.  From the Impact Analysis in Figures 8.1 and 8.2, the proposed qualitative method generally yields higher forecast deltas (e.g., the “Overlay Frequency Multiple” can exceed 3x of recent history), reflecting a more conservative stance on EF and CPBP losses.  The qualitative approach eliminates the need for repeated Tier 2 adjustments, aligns better with recent loss experience, and is expected to deliver more stable and justifiable results for CCAR cycles.

**2. Data Quality and Appropriateness Testing**  
During a recent review of the model development code, it was discovered that different segments (IF, EF, EPWS, CPBP, DPA, EDPM) were outputting their frequency and severity data through inconsistent end-dates, rather than the intended uniform horizon of 2005Q1–2021Q4.  Specifically, IF data was cut off in March 2022, EF in September 2022, EPWS and CPBP in June 2022, and so on.  Although downstream Excel calculations can consolidate or filter these outputs, the inconsistent data windows present a clear risk of misalignment or unintended bias when comparing across segments.

As a result, MRO has raised a risk item requesting that MD implement additional data checks and controls before data is exported to Excel.  These checks will ensure each segment’s output aligns to the same time horizon and is properly validated for completeness and accuracy.  Standardizing the code’s output not only simplifies downstream handling but also reinforces best practices for data governance, improving the overall reliability and transparency of the model’s results.
