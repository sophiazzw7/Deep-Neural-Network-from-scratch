1. Acknowledgment of the Qualitative Approach and Limited Testing Options
* The methodology is qualitative, and traditional testing methods like backtesting, stability testing, and scenario analysis are not applicable due to the nature of the model.
* Developers are using recent 9Q data as the baseline and a 3.5 multiplier for stress scenarios.
* A note should be made, similar to what developers did, to document that this is a qualitative approach and certain testing methods will not be applicable.

2. Seeking Validation and Approval Requirements
* The team is still determining the best way to validate the model given the limitations.
* Question to Alex: If there are no quantitative validation methods, what approvals are required to defend the methodology?
* Developers will provide meeting notes from the Effective Challenge meeting to document that the 3.5 multiplierwas discussed.
* The team needs to secure the meeting notes from the session where the multiplier was specifically discussed and agreed upon, as the current notes mainly cover the methodology switch.
3. Proposed Monitoring Approach and Concerns
* Developers proposed two monitoring components:
    1. Annual review of the 3.5 multiplier to determine if it remains valid.
    2. Review of the relevance of the recent 9Q historical data to assess whether it still reflects the current risk environment.
* Concerns raised:
    * No clear metrics or thresholds were provided to define when adjustments should be made.
    * No formal sign-off process was included for the monitoring reviews.
    * The lack of predefined quantitative criteria may make it difficult to justify future changes to the methodology.
* Alex’s response:
    * The multiplier review must follow the same approval process annually as it did originally.
    * The review will assess historical losses and whether the 3.5 multiplier remains sufficient or needs adjustment.
    * Since the review includes actual loss data, it can serve as a form of ongoing governance monitoring (OGM).
    * While no specific quantitative thresholds were defined, the evaluation of historical losses against the multiplier will determine if adjustments are needed.
* Next steps on monitoring:
    * The team will request documentation on the multiplier review process to clarify methodology and approval steps.
    * They will confirm what form of sign-off will be required for both the multiplier review and the 9Q historical data relevance check.
4. Archer Findings and Documentation Approach
* Two Archer findings are associated with this model:
    1. Development testing Archer finding
    2. OGM-related Archer finding
* The team discussed whether a separate memo is required to address these findings.
* Alex’s response:
    * Instead of a separate memo, the validation report should incorporate an explanation of how the methodology change impacts the Archer findings.
    * The report should clearly state whether the findings are still applicable or no longer relevant due to the switch to a qualitative approach.
    * The goal is to avoid redundant documentation while ensuring the findings are properly addressed.
* Next steps:
    * The team will incorporate the Archer findings into the validation report and provide justifications for any changes in applicability.

5. Timeline and Reporting Deadlines
* Annual Validation Review Task: Due March 10.
* RP Validation Task (OGM Review): Due February 20.
* If the OGM review is not completed by February 20, a separate memo will need to be created instead.
* The OGM review will explain the switch to a qualitative approach, with only two key assumptionsdocumented, rather than a traditional model validation plan.
* Alex’s response:
    * The OGM plan review must be completed by the end of February. If the team cannot meet this deadline, they will need to prepare a separate memo explaining the methodology change and assumptions.
    * The Annual Validation Review will proceed as planned, with March 10 as the final deadline.
    * All relevant updates must be reflected in ServiceNow to track progress and approvals.
* Next steps on deadlines:
    * Ensure OGM review is completed on time to avoid additional memo requirements.
    * Finalize and submit validation tasks by the agreed deadlines.

6. CCAR Compliance and Outstanding Issues
* Alex was asked if there are any specific CCAR requirements the team should focus on.
* Developers do not have time to fully comply with all CCAR elements in this update.
* Alex’s response:
    * Any missing CCAR elements should be documented as sub-issues, so they are properly tracked and addressed later.
    * Given the compressed timeline, developers are making progress, but they may not be able to meet all requirements in this cycle.
    * The team should ensure that outstanding CCAR requirements are clearly identified to avoid compliance gaps in future updates.
* Next steps on CCAR compliance:
    * Document any missing CCAR components as sub-issues for future resolution.
    * Ensure that developers are aware of what is outstanding and what still needs to be addressed in later updates.

7. Next Steps
* Request meeting notes from the session where the 3.5 multiplier was discussed and agreed upon.
* Clarify what approvals are required for the multiplier and 9Q review process.
* Incorporate Archer findings into the validation report.
* Ensure validation tasks are completed and submitted by the agreed deadlines:
    * March 10 for the Annual Review
    * February 20 for the RP Validation Task (OGM Review)
* Ensure CCAR-related gaps are documented as sub-issues for future resolution
