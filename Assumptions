Below is an updated **“Rationale for Discontinuing Back-Testing”** section that incorporates the points from the explanation:

### 3. **Rationale for Discontinuing Back-Testing**

1. **Qualitative Nature of the Four Event Types**  
   - IF, DPA, EDPM, and EPWS rely on **qualitative or multiplier-based** methods using the most recent nine quarters (9Q) of loss data.  
   - Any **forward-looking** elements (e.g., stress multipliers) come from **non-model, expert judgment sources** rather than a statistical forecast.  
   - Consequently, **there is no predictive output** that can be meaningfully compared to actual outcomes.

2. **Backward-Looking Limitation and Lack of Predictive Value**  
   - The approach provides a **backward-looking perspective** for CCAR, reflecting recent operational loss trends rather than forecasting through econometric or regression-based methods.  
   - Because these losses are often **idiosyncratic** and not driven by macroeconomic factors, **historical data is not necessarily indicative of future trends**, making back-testing inherently uninformative.

3. **No Established Thresholds for Validation**  
   - Traditional back-testing requires **clear thresholds** or tolerance limits to judge whether a model’s forecast deviates from actual outcomes in a significant way.  
   - Given that the methodology does **not generate statistical predictions**, there are **no thresholds** to invalidate or confirm the approach, rendering a formal back-test process irrelevant.

4. **Back-Testing Was Relevant Only for Quantitative Models**  
   - Historically, back-testing served to validate regression-based models (e.g., for EF and CPBP).  
   - In contrast, the purely qualitative segments (IF, DPA, EDPM, EPWS) do **not rely on predictive modeling**, so applying back-testing would be **misleading** and yield no actionable feedback.

5. **Consensus Between MRO and Model Developers**  
   - **Both MRO and Model Development** concur that **including back-testing for these qualitative event types is not only unnecessary but also potentially confusing**.  
   - In line with updated MRO policies, these segments will **no longer include back-testing requirements**, as doing so adds no value to model risk management or performance assessment.
