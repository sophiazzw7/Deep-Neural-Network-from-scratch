Absolutely, I'll remove the bold formatting for a cleaner presentation. Here’s the updated assessment:

---

### Sub-Issue ID: F_0001
- Name: OGM Plan Sub-Issue
- Category: Ongoing Performance Monitoring (OGM) Plan
- Updated Determination:
  - Category: Sub-Issue
  - Rationale: Given the model’s low-risk designation (Tier 4), minimal coverage, and its role as a reference tool rather than a primary decision driver, the deficiencies in the OGM plan are less critical. Since prediction accuracy is tracked annually and performing well, the monitoring requirements are adequately met for its current purpose.
  
- Impact and Rationale:
  - Impact: Low to Medium – While enhanced OGM documentation could improve monitoring, current performance is stable, reducing immediate risk.
  - Rationale for Impact: The primary impact is on transparency and documentation rather than operational performance, due to the model’s low reliance.
  
- Root Cause:
  - Category: Process
  - Root Cause ID: RC02.02 – Inadequate Process Design
  - Description: Documentation and metric tracking processes could be improved to ensure all monitoring aspects are clear, although core performance metrics are already tracked.

### Sub-Issue ID: F_0002
- Name: Development Data Sub-Issue
- Category: Data Quality & Data Appropriateness
- Updated Determination:
  - Category: Sub-Issue
  - Rationale: Since portions of data quality information are available, including anomaly tracking, data aggregation, and transformation processes, this is a documentation enhancement need rather than a critical operational issue. The existing data quality checks mitigate major risks associated with data integrity.
  
- Impact and Rationale:
  - Impact: Low to Medium – While improved documentation would be beneficial, existing data quality controls reduce the immediate operational risk.
  - Rationale for Impact: Current data information is sufficient for ongoing model use; additional details would enhance understanding rather than address a pressing risk.
  
- Root Cause:
  - Category: Process
  - Root Cause ID: RC02.02 – Inadequate Process Design
  - Description: The documentation process for data quality checks could be expanded for clarity and comprehensiveness, but core data processes are in place.

### Sub-Issue ID: F_0003
- Name: Model Documentation Sub-Issue
- Category: Model Documentation
- Determination:
  - Category: Sub-Issue
  - Rationale: This documentation update is a governance matter without immediate impact on model functionality or accuracy, aligning well with a sub-issue classification.
  
- Impact and Rationale:
  - Impact: Low – Primarily affects transparency and alignment with updated policies.
  - Rationale for Impact: This is an administrative update, enhancing the accuracy of records but not impacting the model’s operational use or reliability.
  
- Root Cause:
  - Category: Governance
  - Root Cause ID: RC03.04 – Inadequate Policies and Procedures
  - Description: The current documentation practices require an update to maintain compliance and transparency.

This format maintains clarity without bolding. Let me know if any additional changes are needed!
