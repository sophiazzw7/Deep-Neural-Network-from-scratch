### 3. Review of Model Documentation

As part of the Annual Review, MRO examined the most recently updated model documentation, which includes the new qualitative methodology for the EF and CPBP segments (documented in ‚ÄúMOD13638 Operational Risk Loss Forecast Model with qualitative methodology 02132024‚Äù). This updated approach, referenced in Section 10 of the model document, changes EF and CPBP from a quantitative to a qualitative model framework.

Because the current methodology for EF and CPBP is now qualitative, many of the previously documented performance testing methods (e.g., backtesting or formal overlays) are no longer applicable and should be removed or updated. However, given the limited time available for revisions, the development team only provided a brief note about these changes, directing readers to Section 10 for more details. Therefore, MRO will raise a documentation sub-issue so that comprehensive updates can be made at a later stage.

Below are the issues and additional points noted during this review:

1. **Regulatory Requirements and Policy References**  
   - For models subject to specific regulatory requirements (e.g., CCAR/DFAST), the documentation should explicitly state which requirements apply and how they have been addressed.  
   - [Risk Item] Any existing references to policies or procedures (e.g., older references to negative binomial) should be reassessed, updated, or removed if they no longer apply to the model in its qualitative form.

2. **Model Risk Tier Table and MCA Updates**  
   - The model documentation does not include a model risk tier table. Given the methodology change, MRO also suggests that the development team update the Model Change Approval (MCA) to accurately reflect the new qualitative approach.

3. **Model Methodology, Logic, and Input Data**  
   - EF and CPBP methodology is described in the memo (Section 10). However, for the other four segments (IF, EDPM, DPA, and EPWS), the documentation remains unclear on certain points (e.g., frequency stress periods).  
   - Input data is generally specified, but since **GL data is not used** (per the development team), references to GL datasets should be removed for clarity. Data flow and treatment descriptions (particularly in Section 2.5 of the MDD) still contain obsolete or conflicting information.  
   - [Risk Item] Developer‚Äôs data quality and data appropriateness testing are **not provided**. MRO identified a negative severity value (-57,583.81) in the IF segment that needs investigation. The development team should confirm the appropriateness of including negative loss events in both Event_w_exclusion and Event_w_exclusion_dedup. Additional data controls may be warranted.  
   - Any sections still referencing the **negative binomial regression** for EF/CPBP should be updated or removed.

4. **Assumptions, Key Risk Drivers, Model Specifications, and Formulas**  
   - The assumptions for EF and CPBP are included in the memo, and MRO‚Äôs assessment can be found in Section 6 of this IVR.  
   - For the other four segments, assumptions about frequency and severity still need clarity in the main body of the model documentation (Sections 1.5, 3, and 4.3).  
   - Mathematical formulas for the updated model approach are partially detailed, but any reference to out-of-date equations should be removed.  
   - Outcome analysis: Because the model has shifted to a qualitative approach, **traditional backtesting, stability testing, or stress scenario comparisons** are not applicable. Consequently, references to such analyses should be eliminated or reframed (see Section 6 of this IVR for MRO‚Äôs discussion on non-predictive models).

5. **Performance Monitoring Plan and OGM Updates**  
   - With the qualitative approach, the **traditional OGM plan does not apply**. Instead, the development team should outline how they will annually reassess the EF/CPBP multiplier(s) and the recent 9Q data. Enhanced data control measures are also recommended, given the reliance on internal Archer data.  
   - [Risk Item] Updates to the OGM plan should reflect its **complete removal**, as previously used performance metrics are no longer relevant.

6. **Use of GL Data**  
   - While the development team indicated that GL data is excluded due to data entry problems, multiple sections (e.g., Section 2, Figure 48 under Section 5.4) refer to GL data usage for EDPM. The team must clarify whether GL data was used in past developments or remains entirely excluded from future capital forecasting. If GL data is not used, the references and figures implying otherwise should be removed to avoid confusion.

7. **List of Key Model Stakeholders**  
   - [Risk Item] The documentation should include the names (or roles) of the model owner, model developer, model user, and any relevant third-party vendors. MRO recommends the development team confirm the current stakeholder list and update it accordingly.

8. **Business Continuity and Contingency Plan**  
   - The documentation should contain or reference a **business continuity/contingency plan**. This plan was not found in the current document set. MRO requests that the development team include or reference it in alignment with standard operational risk model documentation practices.

9. **Model Exposure**  
   - The scope or ‚Äúexposure‚Äù of the model (i.e., the business areas, portfolios, or risk types impacted) should be clearly stated. This helps stakeholders understand the model‚Äôs reach within Truist‚Äôs operational risk framework.

10. **Model Implementation**  
   - The development team reports that the production code for EF/CPBP‚Äôs revised methodology is still pending finalization. An implementation sub-issue will be raised as part of this validation. Sections 7 (Model Implementation) and 8 (Model Use Controls) must be updated once the code and controls are finalized.

11. **Template Alignment**  
   - Lastly, MRO recommends updating the model documentation to meet the **newest MDD Template** standards. This includes reorganizing or removing obsolete references, clarifying data usage, and ensuring all relevant business objectives, assumptions, regulatory requirements, and stakeholder details appear in the correct format.

After reviewing the updated Section 10 (EF and CPBP memo), MRO affirms that it contains the necessary technical details and analysis for the qualitative approach. However, the broader model document requires the aforementioned revisions to ensure consistency with the new methodology, removal of outdated references (including GL data, negative binomial regression, and OGM), and inclusion of appropriate data controls and stakeholder information.
