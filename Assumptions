The two major limitations in the context of business operations are:

Untracked Activities:
The inability to track a significant portion of branch activities is a major limitation. This can result in the model under or over-forecasting staffing needs, which can directly impact operational efficiency in branch capacity planning.
Proprietary Model:

Both of these limitations impact the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting model, making them key concerns.
