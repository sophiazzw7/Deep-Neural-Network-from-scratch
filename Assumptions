Thank you for the clarification. Here’s an updated section draft to reflect that the override process is external to the model, incorporating the new sub-issue created by the MRO.

### 12.4 Model Overlay Governance & Control

The Model Development Document (MDD) outlines the governance and control mechanisms for handling model overlays and external overrides. The oversight ensures that any adjustments are controlled, justified, and within defined parameters, especially when they influence model-based decisions.

- **Definition of Overrides**: It was clarified by the developers that overrides are applied outside the model itself. These are adjustments made during strategic business decision meetings, led by banking executives, regional leaders, or other stakeholders, based on specific external factors that may influence model-related decisions.

- **Process for External Overrides**: Overrides, as applied in this context, involve business rule adjustments that occur outside the model structure and are directed by strategic needs. Key situations where external overrides may occur include:
  - **Unexpected Staffing Adjustments**: For instance, if multiple team members take leave within a year, affecting operational needs.
  - **Community Developments**: Changes such as new neighborhoods or retirement centers potentially impacting branch activity.
  - **New Business Growth**: Opening of major new facilities (e.g., convention centers, lifestyle hubs) within a branch’s vicinity that may alter customer traffic.

- **MRO Sub-Issue**: Following clarification from the developers, it was identified that these overrides are external to the model. Consequently, the Model Risk Officer (MRO) issued a sub-issue, **F_0002**:
  - **Sub-Issue Name**: Development Data Sub-Issue
  - **Category**: Data Quality & Data Appropriateness
  - **Description**: The "allowable range of overrides" for model output will be removed from the model documentation. Instead, a description of the external override process, handled through strategic decision-making, will be added.
  - **Remediation Plan Owner**: Stacey Honea
  - **Targeted Completion Date**: April 1, 2025

This sub-issue ensures that all stakeholders are clear on the separation of model-based adjustments and external overrides, which are conducted for broader strategic purposes.
