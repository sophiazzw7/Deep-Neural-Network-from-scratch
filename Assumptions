Here's a slightly more natural version while maintaining the formal structure:

**2023 Transition to Anaconda, Python, and piML for Model Validation**

**Key Milestones, Team Actions, and Technical Details**

1. **August 2023: Initial Anaconda Training and Onboarding Support**
   - We launched our Anaconda journey with initial training sessions, though we were limited to just 10 team members at first. To bridge this gap, I developed a comprehensive **Anaconda Navigation Guide** to support everyone who couldn't attend.
   - The guide walked team members through Anaconda's key features and functionality, ensuring everyone could work independently regardless of their training status.
   - Throughout this phase, I provided hands-on support to help teammates overcome common challenges they encountered while getting familiar with the platform.

2. **October 2023: Expanded Access and Second Training Round**
   - After resolving our access constraints, we were able to open up Anaconda to the entire team. This paved the way for a second round of training sessions where we focused on practical, hands-on learning.
   - I deepened my own expertise in Anaconda and Python through additional training, which allowed me to share more advanced insights with the team.
   - Our focus shifted to targeted troubleshooting support, addressing specific challenges that emerged as team members began working more extensively with both Anaconda and Python.

3. **February 2024: Full Team Access and Python Transition**
   - Building on our progress, we secured comprehensive Anaconda training for the full team, with special attention to supporting those transitioning from SAS to Python.
   - I developed and led a targeted session called **"Learning Python as a SAS User,"** introducing valuable resources like the SASPy library and a SAS-to-Python converter to ease the transition.
   - To ensure smooth implementation, I provided detailed documentation for setting up Python environments and installing critical packages (piML, Numpy, Pandas), giving the team the technical foundation needed for effective model validation.
