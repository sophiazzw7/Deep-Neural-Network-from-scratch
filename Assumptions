### **Slide 3: Shift to Anaconda for Data Storage and Access**

- **Project Transition to Anaconda**: After a successful local Python demo, Sophia and the team began planning the transition to Anaconda for better data handling.
  - **Use Case Project in Anaconda**: Sophia worked on establishing a connection from Python to the SAS server using SASPy, troubleshooting class classifier issues needed for workspace setup.
  - **Collaboration with Garrett’s Team**: Met with Garrett’s team to discuss technical requirements and access needs, ensuring that the team could proceed efficiently.

- **Data Migration to Hive Tables**: The team learned that to fully utilize Anaconda, SAS datasets would need migration to Hive tables with an EDL Sandbox for secure storage.
  - **Next Steps by Sophia**: Updated the Anaconda project list, coordinated sandbox setup by reaching out to Cameron from Debarry’s team, and planned with Mary and Ping for necessary data storage and access configurations.

### **Slide 5: Advanced Team Training and Demonstration**

- **July 2024**: Sophia, Ping, Crystal, and Mary conducted a team meeting on MRO Sandbox access and basic Python training.
  - Demonstrated building a regression model, guiding teammates through AD group access requests, and Python usage with PyCharm and Jupyter for hands-on learning.

- **August 2024**: Continued training with additional demonstrations, covering data analysis and a sample project in Python.
  - **August–September 2024**: Successfully transferred SAS data into Hive tables and stored it in the MRO sandbox. Team connected from EDL to Anaconda for efficient data analysis.
  - **October–November 2024**: Submitted IAM requests to secure workspace in Anaconda, now awaiting final setup for seamless operation.

**Slide 2: Onboarding the First Python Project**

- **February 2024**: After the team received Anaconda training, Crystal and Sophia collaborated on launching the first Python project, utilizing Crystal's 4Q 2023 Ongoing Monitoring Dataset for ReMars.
  - **Sophia’s Contribution**: Sophia worked extensively with Crystal to convert Crystal's existing SAS code into Python, focusing on key metrics such as Population Stability Index (PSI) and Somers' D. By setting up the dataset in PyCharm and demonstrating package installation and setup in Anaconda, Sophia ensured a smooth transition into Python.
  
- **Group Training Session Highlights**:
  - **Getting Started with Python**:
    - **Setup and Access**: Sophia led the team through the steps to request and install Python 3.10.5 via Service Now and set up PyCharm through the Company Portal. She shared a custom guide on configuring virtual environments and installing necessary packages, using approved resources such as PiML, Numpy, and Pandas.
    - **Working with Python Packages**: Sophia explained Python’s modularity and introduced packages like PiML for model validation, Pandas for data handling, and NumPy for numerical computations. She used practical examples, including feature importance analysis, to illustrate the functionality of each package, relating them to familiar SAS libraries.
  
  - **Transitioning from SAS to Python**:
    - **SASPy Integration**: Sophia guided the team through SASPy, a Python package allowing Python-based access to SAS datasets. She also introduced the SAS-to-Python converter tool to help teammates familiarize themselves with Python syntax by translating their existing SAS code.
