Understood! Here's a revised version that sticks to recording what was discussed without drawing inferences.

### Meeting Minutes

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Attendees:**
- [List of Attendees]

**Purpose:** Discuss model overrides, ongoing monitoring (OGM) reporting, Tier 3 and Tier 4 model requirements, and performance metrics.

---

### Discussion Points

**1. Model Overrides Clarification:**
- The model does not allow for internal overrides.
- Business teams can override the model's staffing recommendations in separate meetings, but this is independent of the model itself.
- Documentation needs to be updated to remove references to internal overrides and clarify that overrides are business decisions, separate from the model's output.

**2. Ongoing Monitoring (OGM) Reporting for Tier 4 Models:**
- Confusion regarding the requirement for OGM reports. The team was previously told that Tier 4 models did not require OGM reports.
- Clarified that although a standalone OGM report is not required for Tier 4 models, annual performance testing still needs to be conducted and documented.
- The governance team will confirm whether specific OGM sections, such as OGM stakeholders, are still required in the documentation.

**3. Performance Testing Results for 2022 and 2023:**
- The team did not submit performance testing results for 2022 and 2023 due to the misunderstanding of reporting requirements.
- Agreed to compile and submit the 2022 and 2023 performance data.
- Moving forward, performance testing results will be submitted annually, with a potential submission target by the end of 2025.

**4. Metrics for Model Stability and Sensitivity:**
- Stability metrics and sensitivity analysis need to be added.
- Stability metrics could track monthly prediction variances.
- Sensitivity analysis would involve adjusting model inputs (e.g., staffing levels) to evaluate the output.
- The team will explore how to develop and document these metrics.

**5. Assumptions and Limitations Review:**
- The team needs to regularly review and reassess assumptions and limitations in the model, particularly in response to business changes, such as alterations in branch operating hours.
- A plan will be developed to review and update assumptions as part of the ongoing monitoring process.

**6. Remediation Plan for Documentation:**
- A remediation plan is required to close out the review. This plan will include:
   - Documentation updates for overrides, performance testing, and OGM requirements.
   - A timeline for completing the updates and submitting performance testing results.
- The team will draft and share this plan by the end of next week (Friday).

**7. Vendor Model Considerations:**
- The model relies on third-party vendor software, limiting access to detailed development data.
- A high-level summary of vendor data sources and data processing steps will be included in the documentation.
- The team will work with the vendor to provide any available details about data cleaning and preprocessing.

**8. Transition to New Documentation Template:**
- The team is transitioning to a new model documentation template and will incorporate the discussed updates during this process.
- The ServiceNow platform will replace Archer for documentation uploads, but the process should remain similar to the current one.
- Documentation updates will include correcting vendor names and ensuring model version consistency.

### Action Items:

1. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Remove references to internal overrides.
   - Clarify that business overrides are separate from the model's output.
   - Update "model reliance" field to reflect accurate categorization ("some").

2. **Performance Testing Results (2022-2023):**
   - Compile performance data for 2022 and 2023 and submit it.
   - Submit future results annually, with a tentative submission date by the end of 2025.

3. **Vendor-Provided Data Summary:**
   - Work with the vendor to obtain high-level summaries of data sources and processes.

4. **Remediation Plan Development:**
   - Draft a remediation plan and share it by next Friday for review.

5. **Stability and Sensitivity Metrics:**
   - Develop stability metrics and perform sensitivity analysis to track prediction consistency and input-output sensitivity.

6. **Assumptions and Limitations Review:**
   - Establish a review process for model assumptions and limitations.

7. **ServiceNow Transition:**
   - Begin transitioning documentation to the new template for ServiceNow.

**Next Steps:** The team will provide an update on the remediation plan and documentation by [next Friday]. A follow-up meeting will be scheduled to review progress and discuss any outstanding issues.
