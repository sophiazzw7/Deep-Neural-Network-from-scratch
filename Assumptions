**Title:** *2023 Transition to Anaconda, Python, and piML for Model Validation*

**Key Milestones, Team Actions, and Technical Details**

1. **August 2023: Initial Anaconda Training and Onboarding Support**  
   - In August 2023, Sophia took the initiative to register the team for Anaconda training to introduce them to the platform. However, due to limited access, only the first 10 team members were able to participate in this training session.  
   - Recognizing that not everyone had the opportunity to attend, Sophia created a detailed **Anaconda Navigation Guide** to support those who were unfamiliar with the platform. This guide provided step-by-step instructions on navigating Anaconda, enabling teammates to work independently and onboard smoothly.  
   - Throughout the process, Sophia also offered hands-on guidance to address common navigation issues that new users encountered. Her efforts ensured that all team members, regardless of training access, felt equipped to explore Anaconda’s functionalities.

2. **October 2023: Expanded Access and Second Training Round**  
   - By October, Sophia worked to resolve the initial access limitations, making Anaconda fully accessible to the entire team. With everyone onboarded, she organized a second round of hands-on training sessions to encourage active engagement with Anaconda’s tools and resources.  
   - Sophia attended additional training herself, deepening her understanding of Anaconda and Python, and then shared her insights with the team. This fostered a collaborative learning environment, where teammates could build their skills together and ask questions freely.  
   - Sophia also provided targeted troubleshooting assistance, addressing specific challenges that team members faced. This support enhanced the team’s overall proficiency in both Anaconda and Python, strengthening their technical foundation for future work.

3. **February 2024: Full Team Access and Python Transition**  
   - In February 2024, Sophia registered the entire team for comprehensive Anaconda training, this time with a focus on Python programming skills, particularly for team members transitioning from SAS to Python.  
   - Sophia led a specialized session titled **"Learning Python as a SAS User,"** where she introduced teammates to essential tools like the SASPy library and an online SAS-to-Python converter. These tools were chosen specifically to help the team become comfortable with Python syntax and functionalities, making the shift from SAS more manageable.  
   - To further support the transition, Sophia shared detailed setup instructions for creating Python environments and installing essential packages, including piML, Numpy, and Pandas. Her guidance ensured that team members were well-prepared to leverage Python for model validation tasks, equipping them with the necessary technical knowledge for effective data analysis.
