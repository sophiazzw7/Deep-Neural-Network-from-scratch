Below is a concise review of the assumptions and limitations as they apply to the four quantitative segments—**IF**, **DPA**, **EPWS**, and **EDPM**—along with clarification on **EF** and **CPBP**, and notes on data sourcing and GL references.

## 1. Overview of Segments

1. **Quantitative Segments:**
   - **IF** (Internal Fraud)
   - **DPA** (Damage to Physical Assets)
   - **EPWS** (Employment Practices and Workplace Safety)
   - **EDPM** (Execution, Delivery, and Process Management)

2. **Qualitative Segments:**
   - **EF** (External Fraud)
   - **CPBP** (Clients, Products, and Business Practices)

Originally, **EF** and **CPBP** were modeled using a negative binomial distribution with macroeconomic factors, but **they have since shifted to a qualitative approach.** Their updated assumptions and limitations are documented elsewhere.

## 2. Assumptions & Limitations for IF, DPA, EPWS, and EDPM

From the document text, the following assumptions and limitations apply to the four quantitative segments (IF, DPA, EPWS, EDPM):

### **Assumptions**

1. **Model Framework (Loss Distribution Approach / Multiplier Methodology)**
   - Uses historical loss events from Archer (≥10K net loss).
   - Assumes the frequency of operational loss events and their average severity can be treated separately (weak correlation).
   - Frequency is typically estimated using standard count-data models (Poisson, Negative Binomial, etc.), but the model here uses a **non-regression multiplier** for severity.
   - One “stress average” severity multiplier applies across different stress scenarios (no distinction by scenario).

2. **Archer Data Coverage**
   - Loss data is captured from **Archer** at or above $10,000, which is the recommended industry threshold.
   - Data from 2005 to 2021.Q4 is treated as representative of the firm’s operational loss frequency and severity.

3. **Historical Representativeness**
   - Includes major economic downturns (e.g., Great Financial Crisis), assumed to sufficiently cover stress conditions.
   - Data cleansing and manual exclusions are performed, under the assumption they are properly executed.

### **Limitations**

1. **Variability in Operational Losses**
   - Operational losses have **high variance** (heavy-tailed, skewed distributions).
   - Randomness in frequency and severity can challenge accurate statistical estimation.

2. **Single Severity Multiplier**
   - Only one average severity multiplier is used for stress, reducing scenario granularity.

3. **Data Sparsity**
   - Historical coverage starts in 2005; some event types have limited observations.
   - This can affect reliability of frequency and severity estimates.

4. **Manual Data Processes**
   - Data standardization and recovery restatements rely on subject-matter experts; subject to potential human error or incomplete coverage.

5. **Past Model Stability Issues**
   - The quantitative model faced stability challenges, leading to the eventual qualitative shift for EF and CPBP.

## 3. Clarifications on EF and CPBP

- **EF** and **CPBP** were once modeled with a negative binomial distribution incorporating macroeconomic variables.
- **They now follow a qualitative methodology**, with their assumptions and limitations maintained in **a separate document** (not in this version).
- Therefore, **this old document should not contain** any active assumptions or limitations pertaining to EF and CPBP’s previous quantitative approach. If any references remain, they are outdated and should be removed or clearly marked as legacy.

---

## 4. Removal of GL Data References

- The developer confirmed that **only Archer** is used as the data source for loss events.  
- References to **GL data** in the document (e.g., mention of low-dollar GL entries <10K or difficulty mapping GL to Basel event types) are **no longer applicable** and **should be removed**, since they do not pertain to current data sourcing.

## 5. Summary of Recommended Document Edits

1. **Retain** assumptions and limitations relevant to IF, DPA, EPWS, and EDPM as they currently appear (Loss Distribution Approach, severity multiplier method, Archer data source, etc.).
2. **Remove** or clearly mark as “legacy” any statements about EF and CPBP using negative binomial or macroeconomic factors, as those two segments are now qualitative.
3. **Delete** references to “GL data assumptions and limitations,” since the developer clarified only Archer data is in scope.
4. **Ensure** the final document reflects the correct number of quantitative segments (4) and that EF and CPBP’s assumptions or limitations are documented elsewhere.

By following these steps, the document will accurately describe the assumptions and limitations for the four **quantitative** event-type segments and align with the **updated** data sourcing confirmation (Archer only) and the **qualitative** treatment for EF and CPBP.
