### Meeting Minutes

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Attendees:**
- [List of Attendees]
  
**Purpose:** Discussion of model overrides, documentation updates, OGM reporting, and ongoing monitoring for Tier 3 and Tier 4 models.

---

### Key Points Discussed

1. **Model Overrides Clarification:**
   - Overrides are business decisions, not model output alterations.
   - Clarification needed in the documentation to specify that the overrides are external to the model and handled in separate business meetings.
   - Suggestion to remove the section about "allowable range of overrides" and add a description of the decision-making process.

2. **OGM Reporting Requirements:**
   - There was confusion over the need for ongoing monitoring (OGM) reports for Tier 4 models. It was clarified that while standalone OGM reports are no longer required, annual performance testing and documentation updates are still mandatory.
   - A governance team will confirm whether any further action is required.

3. **Updating Ongoing Monitoring Plans:**
   - The team needs to ensure performance testing results are updated annually, even though formal reports may not be required.
   - They will compile the 2022 and 2023 data for submission, with a future plan to submit on an annual basis moving forward.

4. **Next Steps for Documentation:**
   - Updates to the model documentation are necessary, including removing outdated references to secondary use and updating fields such as "model reliance" (set to "some").
   - The model validation team will draft a table with the required updates and share it for review by stakeholders.

5. **Stability and Sensitivity Analysis:**
   - A discussion on the importance of adding metrics to track model stability and sensitivity.
   - Stability analysis could involve tracking month-to-month prediction variances, and sensitivity analysis would include manually adjusting inputs like FTEs to check for appropriate output.
   
6. **Assumptions and Limitations Review:**
   - A review plan is needed for assumptions and limitations to ensure they are still accurate and appropriate.
   - Updates will be incorporated into ongoing monitoring procedures.

7. **Remediation Plan:**
   - A remediation plan will be documented to reflect the agreed actions, including documentation updates and clarifications. The deliverables and timeline will be determined by the end of next week.

8. **Vendor Model Considerations:**
   - For models developed by third-party vendors, it was acknowledged that not all data may be accessible, and high-level summaries will suffice.
   - The team will check what information can be provided and include details about data sources and any data processing done by the vendor.

9. **Model Documentation Transition:**
   - The team is transitioning to a new template for model documentation. The existing document structure will be updated as part of the ongoing model development process.
   - ServiceNow will replace the previous Archer system for documentation uploads.
