### 5. Review of Model Methodology

#### Assessment of Reasonableness

The CloudCords model document outlines an approach to optimize branch staffing using a combination of time-series forecasting for transaction volumes and a customized queuing model for resource allocation. This approach is organized to meet the distinct needs of customer-facing and non-customer-facing tasks. For customer-facing tasks, like teller and platform services, the model uses a customized queuing model instead of traditional methods, such as Erlang-C. This choice was made because the variability in service times and transaction volumes in the banking environment does not align well with the assumptions of traditional queuing models. Conventional queuing models assume predictable service times and customer flow, but field studies in banking show that these patterns are often irregular.

The customized queuing model was chosen because it can better reflect these real-world conditions, allowing for more accurate staffing estimates. For non-customer-facing tasks, such as ATM servicing and vault balancing, the model applies an empirical approach that does not rely on queuing. Since these tasks are scheduled independently of customer arrivals, they do not require the same queuing model and are handled in a way that fits their unique requirements.

However, the documentation lacks detail in certain areas. While it explains the general reasons for choosing these customized methods and provides some evidence to support the choice, it does not clearly describe how often assumptions are updated or validated with new data. Although the document states that updates are made "as needed," it does not specify what triggers these updates or how often data is reviewed. Adding more information about these processes would help clarify the model’s adaptability and reliability over time.

#### Theoretical and Empirical Support

The CloudCords model is built on both theoretical and empirical foundations, combining time-series forecasting and customized queuing theory specifically for banking operations. The documentation states that the model uses the Holt-Winters time-series method to account for seasonal patterns, trends, and regular cycles in transaction volumes. This approach is a good fit for banking, where transaction volumes vary predictably with monthly and weekly cycles, as well as with events like holidays. By using the Holt-Winters method, the model can adjust to these regular changes, which are common in customer behavior in banking.

The model’s design is also supported by data from field studies. These studies showed that traditional queuing models, which assume predictable, exponentially distributed service times, do not reflect actual service patterns in branches. Service times for tellers and bankers vary in ways that these standard models do not capture, so the developers created a customized distribution to better match observed data. This adjustment helps the model make more accurate predictions about staffing needs, aligning its forecasts more closely with actual branch performance.

While the model has a solid theoretical basis and is backed by field data, the documentation could be improved by providing more details in some areas. For example, although the Holt-Winters method is suitable for capturing seasonal patterns, the document does not fully explain how or when these adjustments are updated. It is also unclear how often field data is reviewed and incorporated to keep the model’s parameters in line with current branch operations. Clearer information on how often data is updated and validated would make the model’s adaptability to changing conditions easier to understand.
