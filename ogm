### 1.1 Model Uses, Products, and Exposures

The model, CloudCords, is used to support workforce or staff planning for the Truist Retail Community Bank (RCB) branch network. The model output provides recommendations to develop branch-level staff plans, with a primary focus on producing a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) forecast. This forecast helps branches plan staffing levels by recommending full-time versus part-time positions according to projected client-facing requirements.

The model output, however, serves as only one component in the broader decision-making framework for staffing. Final staffing decisions are influenced by multiple factors, including budget constraints, minimum staffing levels, and input from various stakeholders in the retail banking and HR teams. This layered approach ensures that the model is used within a controlled and contextually informed environment.

#### Product Coverage and Portfolio Size
The model coverage is limited to the Truist RCB branch network. No changes have been made to the model's intended coverage or scope since the last validation.
