Based on the review of MOD11679, the following conclusions were reached regarding model data, methodology/conceptual soundness, and performance:

The model is designed and implemented as expected, with relevant input data and acceptable performance boundaries to support staffing recommendations within the Truist RCB branch network. However, MRO has identified several sub-issues that may impact transparency, threshold robustness, and data quality, which should be addressed to maintain the modelâ€™s reliability over time. Specifically:

- Limitations exist in tracking certain branch activities, which could potentially impact forecast accuracy if left unaddressed.
- The absence of documented rationale for specific performance thresholds raises questions regarding threshold robustness and model sensitivity.
- Documentation gaps in the Model Development Document (MDD) affect transparency and compliance with internal requirements.

Model Rating: Fit for Use with Conditions

Taking into account the identified sub-issues, the assessment of key assumptions, and the current effectiveness of compensating measures, MRO has determined that the model is "Fit for Use with Conditions." While the model is suitable for its intended workforce planning function, it requires ongoing monitoring and remediation actions to address the noted sub-issues and align with Model Risk Management standards.
