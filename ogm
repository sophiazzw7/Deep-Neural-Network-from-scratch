MRO engaged with the development team to verify that no significant, undeclared changes have occurred since the last model validation. This confirmation process revealed that the modelâ€™s fundamental operations, including its inputs, outputs, and core algorithms, have remained consistent with prior specifications.

Although there were no changes impacting model functionality, MRO identified version updates attributed to software enhancements within the CloudCords platform. These updates were not reflected in the model change log, as they did not alter the underlying model structure or performance characteristics.

MRO noted that the model version should be appropriately documented in the MDD (Model Development Document) to maintain consistency, as outlined in Sub-issue F_003, Part 3.
