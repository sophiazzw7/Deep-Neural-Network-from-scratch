### 11.2 OGM Plan Assessment

#### 11.2.1 OGM Plan Granularity
The OGM plan is sufficiently granular and covers key components, such as monitoring forecast vs. actual metrics for teller and platform transactions, branch-specific conditions, and escalation procedures. Data quality controls and variance thresholds are well-defined, ensuring detailed monitoring.

#### 11.2.2 Performance Tests and Monitoring Frequency
Monthly monitoring of actual vs. forecasted transactions and sales is conducted. Variance thresholds are set at ±5% for teller transactions and ±20% for platform services, aligning with business objectives and ensuring effective model performance monitoring.

#### 11.2.3 Performance Metrics and Thresholds
The sole performance metric is the forecast vs. actual, measured monthly. Thresholds are defined as ±5% for teller transactions and ±20% for platform services, providing a sufficient gauge for model accuracy and triggering corrective actions if breached.

#### 11.2.4 OGM Starting Date
The OGM process began in 2021 with consistent monthly monitoring of the forecast vs actual metric across branches.

#### 11.2.5 Model Use Limitation
The model is used to forecast transactions and sales to inform staffing decisions at branches. A key assumption is that CloudCords outputs are aligned with Truist’s internal data, with manual overrides used sparingly and only if variances exceed defined thresholds.

#### 11.2.6 Escalation Plan
If variances exceed the threshold (±5% for teller, ±20% for platform), the Workforce Planning (WFP) team is notified to investigate and implement necessary adjustments. For severe issues, the vendor may be contacted, with escalation response times based on issue severity.
