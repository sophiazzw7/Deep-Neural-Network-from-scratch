Here’s the revised version without inferences:

1. First bullet of FND-17134827:  
The reasoning behind the expected frequency under the BHC Adverse scenario being higher than the frequency rates under the BHC Severe and FRB Severe scenarios for CPBP Basel is not documented. While the updated text states, "The predicted frequencies are a function of macroeconomic variations, and it’s not necessary that the Adverse scenario frequencies are less than the FRB and BHC Severe," could you add more elaborative evidence in Section 6.3 to address this finding? Also, could you clarify why the ranking reversal is only in CPBP and not in EF?

2. Do you have the backtesting results of frequency for all segments for development, stress, and the most recent 9 quarters?

3. Section 6.1.1 of MDD states, "The model owners are aware of the variance and agree that it is within the tolerance limits." Could you clarify what the tolerance limit mentioned here is and provide the proof of model owner acceptance or discussion?

4. Could you share the data quality testing and data appropriateness testing for OGM data?

5. Could you clarify the backtesting results for EDPM, IF, DPA, and EPWS in Section 6.1.1 of MDD? Is it based on the historical average approach?
