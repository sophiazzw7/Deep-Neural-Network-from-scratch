Below is the revised duplicate check code along with a summary you can send to the developer:

### **SAS Code to Check for Duplicates in event_w_exclusion_dedup**
```sas
/* Check for duplicates in event_w_exclusion_dedup */
proc sql;
    create table dup_check as
    select 
        'Internal Events'n as event_id,
        net_loss,
        count(*) as count_occurrences
    from event_w_exclusion_dedup
    group by 
        'Internal Events'n, net_loss
    having count(*) > 1;
quit;

proc print data=dup_check;
run;
```

*Note: This code returns 0 rows, meaning that based on 'Internal Events' and net_loss, there are no duplicate records in event_w_exclusion_dedup.*

### **Email Summary Draft**

**Subject:** Clarification on Duplicate Handling in event_w_exclusion vs. event_w_exclusion_dedup

Hi [Developer's Name],

Iâ€™ve been reviewing our data pipeline and have a question regarding how duplicates are handled between the event_w_exclusion and event_w_exclusion_dedup datasets.

**Observations:**

1. **event_w_exclusion:**  
   - I noticed that in event_w_exclusion, some events appear multiple times with identical values for Posting Date, Gross Loss Amount, Recovery Amount, net_loss, and GL Account, differing only in GL Tracking ID.
   - This suggests that multiple G/L entries exist for the same event.

2. **event_w_exclusion_dedup:**  
   - This dataset is created using a SELECT DISTINCT on a set of key fields (Basel Event Type Level 1, year_event, qtr_event, gl_date, Event Record Type, Internal Events, and net_loss).
   - When checking for duplicates based on Internal Events and net_loss, the duplicate check returned 0 rows.
   - This indicates that event_w_exclusion_dedup has no duplicate records (as defined by these keys), and the differences in fields like Posting Date and GL Tracking ID are intentionally not included in the deduplication.

Could you please confirm if this behavior is intentional? Specifically, should we be collapsing multiple G/L entries for the same event (even if they differ only by GL Tracking ID or Posting Date) into a single record in event_w_exclusion_dedup for aggregation purposes?

I've attached the duplicate check code for your reference.

Thank you,  
[Your Name]

This draft summarizes our observations and asks for clarification on whether the deduplication approach in event_w_exclusion_dedup is intended. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
