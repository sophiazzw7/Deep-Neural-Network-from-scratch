Same Event ID, Same Posting Date, Same Gross Loss & Recovery Amounts
Example: IE-12097866 on 02/27/2019 appears multiple times, each with:
Gross Loss = $88,415.00
Recovery = ($2,415.00)
Net Loss = 86,000.00
GL Account = 860340 (same for all)
The only difference is GL Tracking ID, but that might just be a system artifact.
This looks like a duplicate rather than a true separate transaction.
Same Event ID, Same Posting Date, Different Gross/Net Loss
Example: IE-12097912 on 08/29/2019
First row: Gross Loss = $558,000.00, Recovery = ($558,000.00), Net Loss = $0
Second row: Identical
These are exact duplicates and should be removed before summation.
Different Gross Loss Amounts per Same Event & Date
Example: IE-12097830 on 10/01/2019
Gross Loss = $3,086,682.02 (repeated)
Net Loss = $3,086,682.02
Different GL Tracking IDs
Possible explanation: If this is a duplicate, it could double your severity sum.
Action: Check the source system to see if this is an actual correction or a repeated data entry error.
