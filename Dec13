# **Meeting Notes: Stress Delta and 3.5 Multiplier Discussion**  
**Date:** [Insert Meeting Date]  
**Attendees:** [List of Participants]  
**Subject:** Discussion on Stress Delta, 3.5 Multiplier, and Methodology Changes  

---

## **1. Background on Proposed Stress Delta**
- The **2025 proposed stress deltas** were initially generated from the model.  
- However, these deltas were found to be **extremely high**, prompting a discussion on methodology changes.  
- The initial methodology was **quantitative**, but due to the high deltas, it was proposed to shift to a **qualitative** approach instead.  
- The initial proposal did **not go through**, and the methodology was adjusted accordingly.

---

## **2. Comparison of Different Multiplier Choices**
- A document was reviewed that compared:
  - The **original proposed overlay delta**  
  - The **new 3.5 multiplier delta**  
- The **new multiplier (3.5)** resulted in **smaller deltas**, leading to the decision to adopt a qualitative approach.  
- The primary reason for this shift was not just the delta size but also that the **model results did not make sense** when reviewed.

---

## **3. New Qualitative Methodology and Removal of Scenario Analysis**
- Under the new **qualitative methodology**, **scenario analysis is no longer applicable**.  
- Since this is **not macroeconomic-driven**, there is no meaningful rank ordering between severe and adverse scenarios.
- Previously, the **four event types** used a **single stress delta** for both severe and adverse scenarios.  
- Instead of introducing separate multipliers (e.g., **3.5 for adverse and 4.0 for severe**), it was decided to **keep everything uniform**.
- The approach was aligned with **other methodologies**, ensuring consistency.

---

## **4. Final Decision on the 3.5 Multiplier**
- The **final methodology** applies **3.5 for both severe and adverse scenarios**, meaning there is **no differentiation between them**.
- Since the **same delta** is used, there is **no need to check for rank ordering** between stress levels.
- The rationale is that **historical stress testing** has already accounted for past variations, and the firm is prepared for stress events regardless of severity categorization.
- The logic followed is **"we are prepared for the worst,"** rather than trying to differentiate between adverse and severe stress scenarios.

---

## **5. Next Steps and Urgent Requests**
- A **memo** is being prepared summarizing the proposed changes and their approval.
- Approval **meeting notes** for the **3.5 multiplier decision** need to be documented and attached.
- There is an **urgent request from GCO** related to this, and outreach to relevant stakeholders is ongoing.
- The final logic in the memo will:
  - **Explain the original proposal**  
  - **Attach the approval meeting notes as supporting evidence**  
  - **Ensure alignment with previous qualitative adjustments**
